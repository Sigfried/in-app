   * box recolored itself for a reason outside any of the classes in it.
   *
   * Sorted by id, so a class keeps its index as the schema grows around it in
   * ways that do not touch its own family, and as the canvas changes not at
   * all. Index 0 is reserved for the PARENT, which takes the default; children
   * start at 1. That is what makes "the default" mean "this row is the box's
   * own, not any one child's" rather than "this child happened to sort first".
   *
   * Colors are per-group by design: two classes at index 1 in DIFFERENT groups
   * share a color. That is palette reuse, not a collision — the palette is
   * finite and a group is the only scope in which colors must be distinct.
   *
   * It is NOT how container/contents pairing works, and reading it that way
   * has misled at least one session (2026-09-04).
   *
   * The whole colouring algorithm is three steps, and this function is only
   * the first:
   *
   *   1. every child header takes its palette position — HERE.
   *   2. a slot row is recoloured by its TARGET (`getTargetColor` below).
   *   3. a recoloured row then recolours the child header it BELONGS to
   *      (`borrowed` in mergeSiblings, OwnershipGraphView.tsx) — but only from
   *      a child's OWN rows, since an inherited row is shared by every sibling.
   *
   * Step 3 is what pairs a container with its contents: SdohObservationSet's
   * header is the colour it is because its own `observations` row points at
   * SdohObservation and borrowed it — NOT because the two families sort into
   * matching positions. That correspondence exists today and is not used.
   * Verified by hand 2026-09-04 (SG): renaming MeasurementObservationSet and
   * SpecimenQualityObservation so the families sort differently changed which
   * colours were worn; every pair stayed matched.
