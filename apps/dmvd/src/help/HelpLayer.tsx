/**
 * Everything the help/tour system draws: hint dots, the popover, and the tour's
 * prev/next chrome.
 *
 * **Positioning is CSS anchor positioning** (`anchor-name` / `position-anchor`,
 * Baseline January 2026). Nothing here reads a screen position to set another
 * element's: the browser holds the anchor relationship and keeps it true through
 * scrolls, resizes and canvas relayouts, with no listener, no timer and no
 * re-render. Siggie, 2026-09-08, on why: *"finding the screen position of one
 * thing and then using that to set the position of another thing is kludgy and
 * css should make it so we don't have to do that."*
 *
 * **How the active anchor is named.** `position-anchor` names ONE anchor, but a
 * step's anchor is dynamic — whichever element `resolveAnchor` returns. So the
 * ACTIVE element is tagged `data-help-anchor` as the step changes, and one rule
 * in `help.css` gives that attribute `anchor-name: --help-anchor`; the popover
 * and the spotlight both point at `--help-anchor`.
 *
 * That is a WRITE to one element per step, not a per-frame read of positions,
 * which is why it does not reintroduce what this replaced. It is also why there
 * are no per-kind `anchor-name` rules: the element is looked up once per step by
 * its `data-help-id` and then tagged, so `help-id`, `node-box`, `slot-row` and
 * any kind a future host invents all work the same way, and `src/help/` knows
 * none of their names.
 *
 * Hint dots are the exception, and need per-element names: many are on screen at
 * once, each anchored to a different element. They get `--help-hint-<n>`, from
 * the same one write per element.
 *
 * What stays numeric here is the popover's OWN size — `autoWidth`, `navMinWidth`
 * and the `CHAR_W`/`LINE_H` metrics they share. Those are choices about how wide
 * prose should be, not measurements of anything on screen, and CSS anchoring
 * does not answer them. (`EST_H`/`estHeight`, which guessed the popover's own
 * height in order to place it, are gone: `position-try-fallbacks` and
 * `position-area` use the real one.)
 *
 * The popover is PORTALLED into whichever registered container encloses its
 * anchor (`mountPoints.ts`), so it shares that container's coordinate system —
 * inside the canvas it scales with the zoom and scrolls with the boxes. It
 * used the Popover API's top layer instead until 2026-09-19; that is what put
 * it in a different coordinate system from the thing it points at.

   * Wait for a step's `Change:` to land before showing the popover.
   *
   * The visible bug (Siggie, 2026-08-28): on a step that ticks something, the
   * popover appeared FIRST -- centred, because its anchor did not exist yet --
   * then the checkbox and the Person box appeared, then the popover jumped to
   * the box. Three separate movements for one `next`.
   *
   * The cause is the order the effects run in: `showPopover` is gated on
   * `entry`, which is set the instant the position changes, while the anchor
   * element only EXISTS a render (or a canvas relayout) after the change is
   * pushed. So the popover necessarily appeared before there was anything to
   * attach it to.
   *
   * Held hidden here until the anchor resolves, which collapses that to one
   * movement: the app changes, then the popover appears where it belongs.
   *
   * **Narrowly scoped, on purpose.** Only a position that both pushes a
   * `Change:` and names a resolvable anchor waits at all. `Anchor: none` (step
   * 1) and any step whose anchor is already on screen show immediately, as
   * they always did -- there is nothing to wait for, and a blanket delay would
   * put lag on every `next` in the tour to fix the few that need it.
   *
   * Siggie's ideal is a staged reveal -- checkbox, then 250ms, then the box,
   * then the popover -- which needs the Person box's appearance detached from
   * the checkbox state. Explicitly deferred as too much work for now; this is
   * the part of it that does not need that refactor.

              Siggie asked why interactions appear in help but not the tour;
              the honest answer is that the tour is exactly where someone is
              learning what they can do, so withholding "here is what you can
              do here" was backwards even before the mode went away.
              If a step's popover grows too long, the fix is to shorten that
              entry, not to hide a field the author deliberately wrote.

 *
 * **Markdown is counted, not stripped.** Syntax characters (`**`, `- `, `|`)
 * cost width in a table or a list even though they are not rendered as text,
 * so counting them is closer to right than not, and stripping markdown here
 * would mean parsing it twice.
 *
 * **Beats are not smoothed.** With `Keep:` the blocks grow as beats reveal, so
 * this recomputes and the popover can widen mid-step. Deliberate for now
 * (Siggie, 2026-09-08: "let's see how it works without worrying about width

 * The width the tour's nav ROW needs, which is not a function of the text.
 *

 * controls — counter, reveal dots, the map ⊞, back, next, ✕ — that do not
 * shrink with the text, and at 320 it mangled: Siggie, 2026-09-08, of the
 * 11-screen `admin-study` step, *"too narrow popover mangling the status
 * line"*.
 *
 * Measured at dmvd's 16px base, the CONTROLS come to roughly 295px — they
 * just fit at 320. **It was the dots that broke it**, and that is what decides
 * the design here: the dots are the one elastic part, they WRAP
 * (`.help-tour-dots` in help.css), and the popover is not widened to keep them
 * on one line. A progress hint must not drive the layout — Siggie, same day:
 * *"i don't know about limiting the dot number. better might be to allow the
 * dots to wrap"*.
 *
 * So the floor buys the controls their room plus a short first run of dots,
 * and anything past that wraps onto a second line:
 *
 * | part | px |
 * |---|---|
 * | counter, ⊞, three buttons, gaps | 295 |
 * | popover horizontal padding | 28 |
 * | room for a first line of dots | 70 |
 *
 * (A first version added ~8px of floor per dot and capped the total at twelve.
 * Two mechanisms for one job: wrapping already handles any count, so the
 * per-dot floor only widened popovers that did not need it and the cap was an
 * arbitrary number covering for it.)
 *
 * Deliberately an ESTIMATE in the same spirit as `CHAR_W` — the real fix for
 * both is measuring, which costs a second layout pass per position. Being a
 * little generous is cheap: it only ever raises a floor, and a step whose
 * prose already wants more is untouched.
