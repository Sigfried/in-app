/**
 * Help + tour, as two modes over one registry.
 *
 * Hints and tour are not two features here: they are
 * two navigation states over the same content, the same `data-help-id`
 * anchoring, and the same popover.
 *
 *  - **help mode** — every anchor is marked; click any; self-directed.
 *  - **tour mode** — one anchor at a time, ordered, prev/next.
 *
 * Deliberate departures from the icd11-playground original, both from the plan:
 *
 * 1. **No native-`title` swapping.** The original replaced every tagged
 *    element's `title` and suppressed everyone else's, which is the most
 *    intricate code in `useHelpMode` (SVG `<title>` injection, plus a
 *    restore-on-exit race against React rewriting the attribute). It existed
 *    only because there was no visible way to see which elements have help.
 *    **Hints do that job now**, so the whole mechanism is dropped.
 * 2. **The platform does the overlay plumbing.** Top-layer rendering and
 *    light-dismiss come from the Popover API instead of a portal plus a
 *    deferred-`mousedown` dance.
 *
 * Kept from the original because they are real edge cases, not incidental:
 * capture-phase click interception (so a help click doesn't fall through and
 * actually operate the app), `?` guarded by an input-focus check, two-stage
 * Escape (close the popover, then leave the mode), and exit-on-window-blur.
