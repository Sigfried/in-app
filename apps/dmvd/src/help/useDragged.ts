/**
 * Drag an overlay by its header, for as long as it is open.
 *
 * The cheap half of the overlay work (docs/archive/help-package-shipped-2026-09-08.md §1b). Siggie,
 * 2026-09-08: *"don't do any heavy lifting for the overlays."* Two surfaces use
 * it — the tour's step popover and dmvd's legend / example-cases frame — and
 * neither PERSISTS a dragged position: it lasts while the thing is open and the
 * next open comes back where the layout puts it. That is deliberate, not a
 * shortcut. An overlay dragged somewhere useful for one step is usually in the
 * way of the next, and remembering it would need a place to remember per what:
 * per step, per panel, per selection?
 *
 * ## What it returns
 *
 * `offset` is null until the first real drag, and that null is load-bearing:
 * while it is null the CALLER's own placement runs untouched (the popover's
 * `position-area`, the panel's `right-4`), so nothing has to reimplement a
 * layout in order to be draggable. Once it is non-null the caller switches to
 * absolute coordinates. `reset()` returns to null.
 *
 * ## Why this is possible at all
 *
 * Only because §1 deleted the measured positioning. While a `resize` listener, a
 * capture-phase `scroll` listener and a 250ms interval were all recomputing the
 * popover's `left`/`top`, a dragged position was stomped by whichever fired
 * next. Nothing recomputes it now — the browser tracks the anchor in CSS — so a
 * dragged coordinate simply stays. Dragging was listed as *unblocked by* task 8
 * for that reason.
