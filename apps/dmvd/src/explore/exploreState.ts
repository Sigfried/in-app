/**
 * Explore's shareable state: one place that knows every URL parameter.
 *
 * **The problem this solves.** Selection lived in the URL but the toolbar
 * settings lived in localStorage, so a shared link reproduced the SELECTION
 * and then rendered it with whatever settings happened to be in the
 * recipient's browser — or, for a first-time visitor, the defaults. The
 * sibling merge that the whole inheritance feature is about was a localStorage
 * flag, so a link showing it off looked like the feature did not exist.
 *
 * **The split, and why.** Not everything belongs in a link:
 *
 *  - **Shareable** — anything that changes WHAT the diagram says: the
 *    selection, sibling merge, path-to-root, layout direction, edge merge
 *    mode, the open drawer.
 *  - **Personal preference** — zoom, pan, pins, drags, which side panel is
 *    collapsed. These describe how one person is looking at the diagram, not
 *    what it shows, and pinning them into a link would fight the recipient's
 *    window size.
 *
 * The legend and example-cases OVERLAYS are shareable (Siggie, 2026-09-08),
 * which looks like an exception to that rule and is not: they carry content —
 * the legend explains the very edges a link is trying to show — so "here is
 * the diagram, with the key open" is a different thing to say than "here is
 * the diagram". A collapsed side panel says nothing.
 *
 * Layout direction is a borderline case, filed as shareable: LR vs TB changes
 * how the diagram reads, and a tour step that depends on the shape would break
 * under the other setting.
 *
 * **localStorage stays, as a FALLBACK.** A param that is absent falls back to
 * the stored preference, then to the default — so a bare visit still remembers
 * a returning user's settings, while a link is authoritative for anything it
 * names. That ordering is what lets a tour link pin the settings it cares
 * about without flattening everything else the visitor chose.
 *
 * **Defaults are omitted from the URL.** Keeps links short and readable. The
 * cost is that a later change to a default silently changes old links; the
 * alternative (write everything explicitly) makes every link carry every param.
 * Chosen deliberately — revisit if links start being embedded somewhere
 * long-lived.
