/**
 * How an edge LOOKS — the one place it is decided.
 *
 * The canvas (`OwnershipGraphView`), the legend's samples and the relation
 * popover's rows (`EdgeSample`), and the tour's inline arrows all draw from
 * this module, so a change to a head's shape, a dash pattern or a colour lands
 * everywhere at once. Before 2026-09-10 the canvas and `EdgeSample` each
 * carried their own marker geometry, and the canvas itself drew two sizes of
 * head: the shared convergence head at 12×18 and the per-edge markers at 9×12.
 * Forward edges mostly converge and backward edges never do, so forward heads
 * read as bigger — Siggie: "i've never really liked the forward arrowhead
 * being bigger than the backward arrowhead". One geometry now.
 *
 * Colours stay in `appConfig.EDGE_COLORS` (P2 of the three palettes) and are
 * re-exported through `kinds` so a consumer needs only this module.
 *
 * **Per-kind appearance is NOT declared here.** It comes from
 * `OWNERSHIP_VERDICTS` (src/models/ownershipRules.ts, reached through
 * DataService), the one declaration that also holds each rule's predicate,
 * verdict and human text — so adding an edge kind is one entry there rather
 * than an edit in five files. What stays here is the geometry every kind
 * shares: head size, stroke widths, the dash pattern, the marker glyphs.
