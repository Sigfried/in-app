/**
 * Zoom/pan machinery ported from icd11-playground NodeLinkView.
 *
 * Structure: a scroll container holds a spacer div (sized to zoomed content,
 * so native scrollbars provide panning) which holds a wrapper div that gets
 * a GPU-composited CSS scale transform. Zoom bypasses React entirely: the
 * transform is applied in a requestAnimationFrame.
 *
 * Ctrl/Cmd+wheel (and trackpad pinch, which browsers report as ctrl+wheel)
 * zooms; plain wheel scrolls natively.
 *
 * TWO ZOOM PATHS, and the difference is animation (see ./anim.ts):
 *
 * - DISCRETE (`zoomToFit`, the +/−/1:1 buttons): one step to a known level, so
 *   the wrapper transitions over `animMs()` in step with the node boxes and
 *   the spacer, and the scroll reset is smooth. Without this the boxes slide
 *   to their new ELK positions inside a frame that snapped instantly, which
 *   is why selection changes read as unanimated.
 * - LIVE (ctrl+wheel / pinch): a stream of levels, one per event. A transition
 *   here would leave the wrapper permanently `animMs()` behind the fingers
 *   driving it, so this path stays instant and the spacer resize (a layout
 *   reflow) is debounced ~100ms so it does not run per wheel tick.
 *
 * Panning is drag-to-pan on the background (mouse or touch), implemented by
 * moving the container's scroll offsets. Scrollbars alone were not enough:
 * fit-to-view clamps the content to fit, which leaves nothing to scroll, so
 * there was no way to pan a fitted graph at all. Drags starting on an
 * interactive element (a node, a button) are ignored so clicking a node still
 * opens the drawer.
 *
 * PAN SLACK: the spacer carries padding of PAN_SLACK × the container's size on
 * every side, so there is always room to pan — a fitted diagram included.
 * Without it a box the fit placed under the floating toolbar could not be
 * moved out from under it, and a box dragged above the content's top edge
 * left the scrollable area for good (Siggie, 2026-09-09: *"if i drag a box
 * off the screen to the top i can never get it back again"*). The fit scrolls
 * to the padding's inner corner, so a fitted diagram still sits where it did.
 */

/**
 * Room to pan beyond the content, as a fraction of the container's size on
 * EACH side.
 *
 * HALVED to 0.25 on 2026-09-19, when the popover moved inside the canvas.
 * Siggie's conjecture, which the placement plan rests on: the extra space to
 * pan into at fit-to-view was added *so the tops of overflowing popovers could
 * be reached*, and that is why a fitted diagram scrolls at all. Confirmed in
 * the comment below, which cites "anything floated over the canvas" — the
 * popover — as half its purpose. That half is now unnecessary: a popover is in
 * the canvas and bounded by `--help-vh`, so it cannot overflow the viewport
 * and be unreachable.
 *
 * What the slack still buys is the OTHER half, and it is why this is not zero:
 * a box dragged past the content's edge must be draggable back (Siggie,
 * 2026-09-09: *"if i drag a box off the screen to the top i can never get it
 * back again"*). A quarter-viewport is room to recover a dragged box without a
 * fitted diagram floating in the middle of a scroll area twice its size.

/*
 * FITTING NO LONGER DODGES THE TOUR POPOVER, deliberately (2026-09-09).
 *
 * There used to be a `fitViewport` here that shrank the fit by the popover's
 * horizontal overlap with the canvas. It was added because the popover is in the
 * browser's TOP LAYER — nothing in the canvas can stack above it — so a fit
 * aimed at the full container lays boxes out underneath it and they are simply
 * invisible (Siggie, 2026-08-28: a box added on tour step 2 landed behind the
 * popover).
 *
 * It never worked, and produced two bugs of its own: it could fit the diagram
 * into a sliver, and because `zoomToFit` scrolled to the origin it parked the
 * diagram right back under the popover it had just made room around. Siggie,
 * 2026-09-09: *"why don't you just remove any attempt for zoom to account for
 * popovers?"*
 *
 * The right fix is that the popover should not sit over the canvas in the first
 * place — a placement problem, in HelpLayer, where the popover's position is
 * actually decided. Compensating for it here meant this file tracking a rect it
 * does not own, guessing which side was free, and getting both wrong.
 *
 * So: a fit fits the container. Do not reintroduce popover-awareness here.
