 * duration for debugging silently stretched every fade with it, so a fade
 * could never be judged against a move — which is how the fades came to look
 * wrong. Movement and fades are set independently below.
 *
 * A third kind, not here: the 120ms hover fades (dimming, stroke-width) are

 *
 * ONE exception to independence, and it is a real constraint rather than a
 * convenience: the three MOVEMENT durations (boxes sliding, wrapper rescaling,
 * fit scrolling) must agree, or the boxes finish sliding inside a frame that is
 * still moving. That is what "the animation isn't happening" turned out to be —
 * the boxes were transitioning under an INSTANT container rescale. They share
 * ANIM_MS for that reason.
