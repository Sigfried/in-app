/**
 * dmvd's anchor tags: the string every anchorable element wears so the tour can
 * point at it.
 *
 * REPLACED `helpResolvers.ts`, a table of one lookup function per kind
 * (docs/archive/help-package-shipped-2026-09-08.md §1a). Each element now carries its WHOLE anchor in
 * `data-help-id` — `node-box:Participant`,
 * `slot-row:MeasurementObservation.observation_type` — written at the render
 * site, and the help package finds it with one `querySelector`.
 *
 * This stays on the dmvd side of the package seam for the same reason the
 * resolvers did: knowing that a class has a row, or that a merged child has a
 * header strip instead of a box, is dmvd's knowledge. What changed is only HOW
 * the element is found. The parser still splits `kind:argument` and stops, and
 * the host still decides what each kind means — by choosing which elements to
 * interpolate it onto. The package matches a string it never interprets.
 *
 * | Kind | Element | Tagged at |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `entity-row:<E>` | that class's row in the left panel, LIST MODE | `SelectionTable.tsx` |
 * | `entity-checkbox:<E>` | the checkbox in that row | `SelectionTable.tsx` |
 * | `category-row:<id>` | a category's header bar, LIST MODE | `SelectionTable.tsx` |
 * | `node-box:<E>` | a whole entity box | `OwnershipGraphView.tsx` |
 * | `child-header:<E>` | a merged child's header strip | `OwnershipGraphView.tsx` |
 * | `slot-row:<E>.<slot>` | one attribute row in a box | `OwnershipGraphView.tsx` |
 * | `relation-bar:<E>` | one box's relation bar | `OwnershipGraphView.tsx` |
 * | `legend-panel` | the whole Legend panel | `OwnershipLegend.tsx` |
 * | `legend-section:<id>` | one section of the Legend | `OwnershipLegend.tsx` |
 * | `legend-rule:<rule-id>` | one rule's block in the Ownership legend | `OwnershipLegend.tsx` |
 *
 * `help-id:<id>` is the one kind the package owns: it is a
 * hand-written literal (`data-help-id="graph-canvas"`), not built here.
 *
 * **Not resolving is normal, not an error.** A box is only tagged when the
 * current selection draws it; a row only when its box is expanded. The help
 * layer degrades to an unringed popover. Two cases are deliberately shaped that
 * way:
 *
 *  - **`node-box:` on a merged CHILD does not resolve.** Merged siblings share
 *    one box, titled by their parent; a child has no box, only a header strip
 *    inside the parent's. The old resolver fell back to "the box containing a row
 *    this class declares", which returned the PARENT's box under the CHILD's
 *    name — and returned null for a child that narrows nothing. Same anchor, two
 *    meanings, failing silently either way. Siggie, 2026-09-08: *"it's not a
 *    nodeBox, there's no reason to try to look for it as if it were."* A merged
 *    child is addressed `child-header:`.
 *  - **`entity-row:` does not resolve in TREE mode.** The row rect there is
 *    DagBrowser's own `.dbw-row` wrapper, which dmvd does not render and cannot
 *    tag. Every live `entity-row` anchor is authored for list mode, the default.
