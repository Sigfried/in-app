 * One edge, drawn the way the canvas draws it, at legend size.

 * the look comes from `edgeStyle.ts`: the head glyph and its proportions, the
 * dash, the colour, which ends carry heads and which way they point. This file
 * only scales that geometry down to a 14px-tall sample, so a change there is
