/**
 * RelationBar — the `←─ N     M ─→` chip on each entity box, and the two
 * popovers behind it.
 *
 * Replaces the cascading relation menu, deleted 2026-09-04 (Siggie: "i hate
 * the cascading menu for related entities"). That menu made you traverse five
 * branches to find one class, and the branch labels ("belong to me by their
 * attribute") were the only place the vocabulary appeared, so reading them was
 * mandatory. Here the split is spatial and needs no vocabulary at all.
 *
 * ## The two arrows are POSITION, not verdict
 *
 * This is the distinction that matters, and it is easy to collapse by mistake:
 *
 *   - The arrows ON THE CHIP mean "to my left" and "to my right". Classes are
 *     laid out owner-first, so everything that OWNS me is drawn to my left and
 *     everything I OWN is drawn to my right. `←─ N` is therefore "N classes I
 *     belong to"; `M ─→` is "M classes I own".
 *
 *   - The glyph ON EACH ROW is the edge's KIND, which is a different fact: it
 *     says which end of the line carries the arrowhead, and therefore which
 *     class declares the slot.
 *
 * Both kinds appear on both sides. Of the four classes that own `Observation`,
 * three do so because Observation declares a single-valued pointer at them
 * (own-bkwd, `--<`) and one because ObservationSet declares a collection of
 * them (own-fwd, `-->`). A reader scanning the left popover sees both glyphs,
 * and that is the information the glyph carries — not the side, which the
 * heading already gave.
 *
 * The five RelationPositions decompose onto exactly these two axes:
 *
 *   position        side   kind          glyph
 *   owned-mine      left   own-bkwd      --<     I point at it; it owns me
 *   owned-theirs    left   own-fwd       -->     it collects me
 *   owns-mine       right  own-fwd       -->     I collect it
 *   owns-theirs     right  own-bkwd      --<     it points at me
 *   association     left   association   <-->    neither owns the other
 *
 * `association` sits on the left because the layout orders its target first,
 * exactly as own-bkwd does — geometry, not an ownership claim.
 *
 * Opens on hover with a close grace period, like the menu it replaces; the
 * popover portals to the body because the box lives inside the zoom/pan
 * transform, where a positioned child would be clipped and scaled.

/**
 * One end of a row: a class name, qualified with its slot when that class is
 * the one declaring the relationship.
 *
 * Colour is the class's OWN P3 sibling colour — the same one its box header
 * and its rows wear on the canvas, so `MeasurementObservation` is the same
 * blue here as it is there, and rows belonging to the parent stay in the
 * default ink. That is what makes a row scannable against the diagram
 * (Siggie, 2026-09-04: "blue because it's a blue child class on both sides").
 *
 * **The class NAME is what opens details** — not the whole row, and not a
 * separate ⓘ button, which was redundant with it (Siggie, 2026-09-04). Adding
 * and hiding is the `+`/`−` control instead, so the two actions a row offers
 * are on two different targets rather than competing for one click.
 *
 * The slot suffix is not a click target: it names an attribute, and there is
 * nothing to open for one here.
