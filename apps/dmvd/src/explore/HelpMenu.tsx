/**
 * HelpMenu — the header's cascading Help menu.
 *
 * Replaces the `example cases` header link and the two-tab pane behind it
 * (docs/archive/NEXT_SESSION_EDGE_DISPLAY.md §2.2). Those tabs put the legend and the
 * example cases side by side as peers, which they are not: the legend is a
 * permanent feature deriving every slot classification live from the
 * classifier, and the cases are a working set that keeps shrinking. Tabbing
 * them together said otherwise.
 *
 * The menu is what a lost reader opens, so the three things they might want —
 * the tour, the legend, an example — are one hover apart. The legend and the
 * cases open as INDEPENDENT panels: either can be closed without the other,
 * which is the concrete thing the tabs made impossible.
 *
 * Help-content sections are surfaced through `showEntry`, the same call help
 * mode used to make. Help MODE stays off (HELP_MODE_ENABLED) — this reaches
 * individual entries without reinstating the mode around them.
 *
 * Hover-to-open with a close grace period, matching RelationBar's popovers.
 * The two do not share code: RelationBar portals out of a zoom/pan transform
 * and coordinates "at most one open" across dozens of instances. This one is a
 * singleton in normal document flow, and inheriting that machinery would cost
 * more than the ~40 lines it saves.

 *
 * **This list is the ONLY way into a help-only entry today.** The other route
 * was help mode's `?` hints, and `HELP_MODE_ENABLED` is false — `HelpLayer`
 * renders those hints only `if (helpMode && !inTour)`, so a `data-help-id` tag
 * anchors and rings but opens nothing when clicked. So an entry missing from
 * here is unreachable rather than merely unlisted, which is what
 * docs/tasks.md's caution about deleting menu items is pointing at.
 *
 * `node-dismiss` was in exactly that position — tagged in
 * `OwnershipGraphView` and reachable from nowhere — and is listed now. So was
 * `selection-tree-mechanics`, which became help-only when the *Reading the
 * diagram* tour folded into *Using the Explorer* (2026-09-17): it documents
 * the panel's TREE mode, where its own `entity-row:` anchors do not resolve,
 * so it was a good entry and a broken tour step.
