/**
 * HelpPanel — the floating shell the ownership legend and the example cases
 * each open into.
 *
 * Extracted when the two-tab pane was split (docs/archive/NEXT_SESSION_EDGE_DISPLAY.md §2.2).
 * They are separate panels now precisely so either can be closed without the
 * other, but they still want identical chrome, and two copies of a sticky
 * header with a close button is how they start to drift.
 *
 * **Draggable by its header, and resizable from its corner** (§1b of
 * docs/HELP_PACKAGE_PLAN.md). One frame serves both panels, so both got it from
 * one change — which is the reason the plan paired them. Neither position nor
 * size is remembered: reopening puts the panel back where the layout puts it.
 *
 * ⚠️ This does NOT fix the symptom that opened the overlay item — the legend
 * still COVERS the detail drawer, because the drawer is an in-flow `w-96` column
 * and making it an overlay is the layout change that item is really about. What
 * this buys is that you can drag the legend off it.
 *
 * `offset` staggers a second open panel so it does not land exactly on the
 * first. Still not a window manager: two is the most that can be open, and
 * dragging is per-open, so there is no arrangement to manage.

         viewport coordinates. `absolute`/`right-*` and an explicit `left` cannot
         both drive it, so the classes go when the inline style arrives.

         Width and the offset are inline for a different reason: both come from
         PANEL_WIDTH_REM, and Tailwind cannot emit a class for a value it only
         sees at runtime. They were `w-[26rem]` and `right-[27rem]` literals in
         two files, which is precisely how a wider panel would have slid under
         the one it is supposed to sit beside. `maxWidth` keeps a wide panel off
         a narrow viewport.

         `resize: both` is the free native resizer the plan wanted, and it needs
         a non-`visible` overflow to appear — which `overflow-y-auto` already
         gives. It only offers the corner grip; nothing here implements one.

         The height cap is a `maxHeight` here rather than `max-h-[80vh]` in the
         classes because a CSS max ALSO caps the native resizer: dragging the
         corner down simply stopped at 80vh, which read as the grip breaking
         (Siggie, 2026-09-11). It is now measured from the panel's own top so
         the default reaches the bottom of the viewport instead of stopping a
         fifth short, and `resize` may still be dragged past it. */
