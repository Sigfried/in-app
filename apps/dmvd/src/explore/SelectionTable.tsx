/**
 * SelectionTable — category-grouped entity multi-select for the Explore SPA.
 *
 * Category headers + checkbox rows. The five count badges the Explorer's
 * entity table shows (Props / Cls / Enm / Typ / Vars) were REMOVED here on
 * 2026-08-27: in a panel whose job is finding an entity by name, five
 * always-on numeric columns cost ~120px of the name column while three of
 * them read mostly "·". The counts still live in the Explorer's entity table
 * and the detail panel; see WORKLOG.md for the full reasoning.
 *
 * Within a category, classes nest by inheritance (`getCategoryTrees()`).
 * Nesting is presentation only — the selection contract is unchanged:
 * `selectedIds` + `onToggle(classId)`, one checkbox per class, no cascade from
 * a parent to its subclasses. `Entity` never appears: it is uncategorized by
 * design (entityCategories.ts, UNCATEGORIZED_BY_DESIGN), so the classes that
 * extend it are category roots.
 *
 * Each header also carries a CONTENT VIEW control (`⊞`) that replaces the
 * canvas with that category's members plus its pins — the "what does this part
 * of the model contain" answer the app had nowhere else. See
 * `EntityCategory.pins` and `config/categoryView.ts`.
