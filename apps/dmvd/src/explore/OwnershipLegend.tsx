/**
 * OwnershipLegend — what the diagram's ink means, then every ownership pair in
 * the schema grouped by the rule that classified it.
 *
 * A PERMANENT feature, and its own panel since 2026-09-04. It used to be a tab
 * of the example-cases pane, which said the two were peers; they are not. The
 * cases are a working set that keeps shrinking. This explains the diagram.
 *
 * Everything in the pair listing is derived live from `classifySlotEdgeExplained`
 * via DataService — the same call the graph builder makes. Nothing is restated.
 * That is deliberate and load-bearing: `REFERRED_TO_ENTITIES` and
 * `NAMED_BACK_POINTERS` are hand-curated and go stale silently on every schema
 * sync, so a legend built from a second copy of the rules would conceal the
 * drift it exists to reveal. If a pair looks wrong here, the classification is
 * wrong, not the legend.
 *
 * **Four pivots per rule, over one set of pairs** (`SHAPES` in ownershipPivots.ts).
 * Every count and the tree it opens read off the same key function
 * (`ownershipPivots.ts`), so a number cannot disagree with its own list.
 *
 * Every section groups **owner → attribute → owned**, so the top-level row
 * means the owner everywhere. ⚠️ Grouping on `p.range` instead looks equivalent
 * and is not: `own-bkwd` flips ownership, so one key lands on opposite roles
 * depending on the section, at the same visual level with no cue.
 *
 * The colors are read from the SAME constants the canvas strokes, never a
 * Tailwind approximation of them, for the same reason: a legend that can drift
 * from the thing it explains is worse than none.
 *
 * "Biggest fans" moved OUT of here and into the example cases (TASKS,
 * "example-cases pane needs restructuring", item 3). It ranks convergences so
 * one can be loaded as a selection, which is case-finding, not legend.
 *
 * Clicking any class name selects it, so the listing doubles as a way to build
 * an ad-hoc case from whatever it turned up.

            The accounting that makes 149 the anchor, and so makes `total`
            legible as the fourth pivot. It REPLACED a "two kinds of exception"
            paragraph that named no numbers.
            Every count is LIVE (`{{ownership-count:…}}`, TASKS
            `markdown-everywhere` item (c)) — hand-copied counts in help text
            have already gone stale twice, and this panel now quotes nine of
            them.
            ⚠️ The two backward numbers count DIFFERENT KINDS of thing and must
            not be given parallel phrasing: the first list is keyed by 5
            ENTITIES covering 55 attributes, the second is 5 ATTRIBUTES over 2
            entities. An earlier draft read "55 owner entities / 5 source
            attributes", which reads as one kind.
            ⚠️ What distinguishes the by-attribute five is NOT that their
            sources point both ways — `SdohObservation` does too and is not in
            the list. It is that their TARGETS are themselves owned by another
            attribute, which is why the key is `Class.slot`.
            This prose also carries what the dropped rule indent used to say:
            that the two backward rules are EXCEPTIONS, not peers of the first.
