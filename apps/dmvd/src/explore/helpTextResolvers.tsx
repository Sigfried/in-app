/**
 * dmvd's TEXT resolvers: what a `{{kind:arg}}` placeholder in help content is
 * replaced with.
 *
 * The same seam as `helpResolvers.ts`, for the same reason. Resolving
 * `{{model-description:Participant}}` means knowing what a BDCHM class is,
 * which `src/help/` must not (docs/HELP_PACKAGE_PLAN.md); the package only
 * knows how to find `{{kind:arg}}` and hand `arg` to whoever registered
 * `kind`. These are handed to `<HelpProvider textResolvers={...}>`.
 *
 * **Why placeholders rather than deriving text from the step's `Anchor:`.**
 * Siggie, 2026-09-08: "i prefer explicit". A step anchored at
 * `entity-row:Participant` could have silently gained that class's
 * description, which is less to type but hides where the text came from and
 * has no answer for a step with no anchor. A placeholder says so at the point
 * the text lands, and composes with authored prose around it — you can write
 * a sentence of framing and then drop the model's own words in beneath it,
 * which a whole-field override could not do.
 *
 * | Kind | Fills with |
 * |---|---|
 * | `{{model-description:<Class>}}` | that class's `description` from the schema |
 * | `{{enum-description:<Enum>}}` | that enumeration's `description` |
 * | `{{category-label:<id>}}` | a category's display label (`admin` → "Admin / Study") |
 * | `{{ownership-count:<key>}}` | a live count: `declared`/`forward`/`backward`, or `<rule-id>.<owners\|attrs\|owned\|total>` |
 * | `{{schema-count:<key>}}` | a live whole-schema total; the fields of `SchemaCounts` |
 *
 * **Returning undefined leaves the placeholder standing**, visibly, in the
 * popover. That is the designed behaviour for a name the schema no longer has
 * — an upstream sync renaming a class is exactly the drift this has to
 * survive, and a literal `{{model-description:Gone}}` on screen names the
 * missing thing where a silently empty popover would hide it. `helpContent`
 * tests assert every placeholder in the content file resolves, so the drift
 * shows up as a red test first.
