/**
 * OwnershipGraphView — the layered ownership DAG (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
 *
 * Bindings over graph-core: HTML entity nodes (title + attribute rows) are
 * absolutely positioned over an SVG edge layer. Layout and edge routing are
 * both ELK's (layered, orthogonal). An edge joins an ATTRIBUTE on one class to
 * another class AS A WHOLE, so its two ends are not alike:
 *  - the ATTRIBUTE END attaches to a fixed-position ELK port at its slot's own
 *    row, and is the only end that names a slot;
 *  - the ENTITY END attaches to a header-level port on the target class, so
 *    edges "point at the entity name". ONE exception since 2026-09-02: a
 *    slot_usage-narrowed edge arriving at a merged box lands on the CHILD
 *    HEADER row matching its range, because pointing at the box header would
 *    say only "an Observation" — the one thing the narrowing refines. See
 *    childHeaderTarget.
 * Routing therefore sees the real attach points.
 *
 * Channel rules:
 *  - ownership: solid, in P2's Blues ramp (own-fwd darker than own-bkwd),
 *    drawn owner → member (normalized). Flipped
 *    storage direction is marked at the member end: the arrowhead points
 *    BACK toward the owner (the member stores the FK).
 *  - association: dashed, the lightest step of the same ramp, drawn in FK
 *    direction. The dashes carry the distinction, not faintness.
 *  - is-a: never an arrow in the ownership plane. Rendered as ADJACENCY —
 *    siblings sharing a parent collapse into one box titled by that parent,
 *    parent rows in the default color and bolder, each sibling's own rows in
 *    the color of what they point at (see siblingMerge.ts). Toggleable; off
 *    leaves the is-a chips.
 *  - self-loops: ⟲ marker on the slot's own row, not a routed edge.
 *
 * Row policy: by default a node shows the rows that carry a drawn edge
 * (plus ⟲ self-loops); a "+N more" footer expands to ALL entity-ranged
 * slots (dimmed rows = ranges not on canvas; future expand-on-demand).
 *
 * Talks to services/DataService only (per app architecture rules);
 * graph-core is pure layout code with zero app imports.

 * ANCESTOR of this row's declarer — the subclass added nothing, so the two
 * state one fact twice. Without `parentOf` every row is kept, which is what
 * the unmerged case wants anyway (no member union, so no repeats to find).
 *
 * Deliberately not keyed on `inheritedFrom` from the schema: a subclass may
 * re-declare a slot via `slot_usage` with a narrower range, and that row is a
 * different fact that must survive. Comparing the ROWS catches exactly the

   * WHICH BOXES A TOUR STEP IS POINTING AT, so the others can be dimmed.

   * popover once the popover moved into the canvas: *"try just dimming the
   * unselected node boxes instead of the whole viewport"*. dmvd can be precise
   * about that where the package cannot, because a node box is a thing it
   * knows about.
   *
   * Read from the DOM rather than passed down, and that is the same seam every
   * other help integration here uses: `src/help/` tags whichever elements the
   * step resolved to (`data-help-anchor`, `data-help-spotlight`) and publishes
   * `data-help-scrim` on the documentElement while a step is actually dimming
   * — `Highlight: ring` and `none` set nothing, so honouring the field costs
   * nothing here. Nothing is imported from the package and no prop crosses.
   *
   * It has to end up in the INLINE opacity rather than in a stylesheet rule:
   * the boxes are `motion.div`s whose `animate={{opacity}}` writes inline, and
   * inline beats a class. A `helpTheme.css` rule was tried first and measured
   * to lose (every box stayed at 1).

   * OF THE BASE of a single arrowhead, which is drawn once per group (see
   * `arrowPath`). So the point recorded here is the base centre, which sits
   * ARROW_LEN further out from the border than the tip: tip at ARROW_GAP off
   * the border, base a whole arrow-length beyond that.
   *
   * `dir` is the unit vector the arrow points along (tipward). In LR that is
   * ±x with a vertical base; in TB it is ±y with a horizontal base, which is
   * what swaps the arrow's span/length axes.
   *
   * Keyed the same way buildSpec keys its fan, so a group merges iff ELK fanned
   * it. Only ENTITY-end arrivals merge — the attribute end is anchored at its
   * slot's own row and must stay there.
   *
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Child-header arrivals do NOT merge.
   *
   * An edge from a slot_usage-narrowed slot lands on the CHILD header matching
   * its range rather than on the box header (see childHeaderTarget). Those
   * arrivals are skipped here entirely and draw their own arrowhead at their
   * own port: the ObservationSet case spreads over FOUR arrival rows — the
   * three children plus Observation itself, which carries
   * ObservationSet.observations on the parent row — with exactly one edge
   * each, so there is nothing to converge.
   *
   * That is a fact about the CURRENT schema, not an invariant: measured
   * 2026-08-31 and re-measured 2026-09-02, no member or parent of any
   * multi-child family has more than one inbound edge. `mergedEdges.test.ts`
   * asserts it. If that guard ever fails it does NOT mean the code broke — it
   * means the schema grew a second slot narrowing to the same child, the
   * no-merge shortcut no longer holds, and this map must become row-aware
   * (key on arrival row, position from the row's y instead of HEADER_H/2).
   * Do not just delete the assertion.

   * The HEADER_H/2 geometry below therefore still applies only to box-header
   * arrivals, which is all that reaches it.

                  A node the spec dropped leaves `vm` on the click render, and
                  AnimatePresence keeps its LAST RENDERED element mounted —
                  content, position, handlers and all — until `exit` finishes,
                  then unmounts it. That is the whole of departure: the real
                  box fades where it stood (Siggie, 2026-09-09, on the inert
                  silhouette this replaced: *"just put the real box back. if
                  user messes with it, that's their problem."*). It is also
                  the first stage of the choreography for free — a departure
                  starts at the click, while the survivors cannot move until
                  ELK lands, and arrivals wait ENTER_DELAY_MS on top of that.

                  A node that arrived in `vm` but has no position yet (its
                  layout is still pending) renders nothing until it does, then
                  mounts at `initial` and fades in after the enter delay.

                  initial={false}: the first layout is a load, not a
                  transition, so nothing fades in.

                              comes first it spent the whole budget: 35 of the
                              schema's 87 range names are over 18 characters
                              (up to `SpecimenProcessingActivityTypeEnum`, 34),
                              so on those rows the cardinality was clipped to
                              `0…` or pushed out of the box entirely — which is
                              how `Person.species` and `Person.breed` came to
                              show no cardinality at all. Cardinality is four
                              characters of fixed width and is never the thing
                              worth dropping; `shrink-0` keeps it whole and the
