/**
 * Tour state: who put what on the canvas.
 *
 * **The problem.** The app has ONE selection — a set of class ids. Two parties
 * write to it: the viewer (ticking checkboxes) and the tour (steps that need
 * something drawn). A set cannot remember who put what in it, so when a step's
 * contribution is taken back, something has to stop it taking a class the
 * viewer ticked themselves.
 *
 * **The model (Siggie, 2026-09-07).** Store both halves outright rather than
 * deriving either:
 *
 *  - `held` — the viewer's selection, as the tour found it and as they edit it.
 *  - `tempHeld` — classes the viewer ticked while a replace was suppressing
 *    `held`. Empty until the first `Only:`.
 *  - `tour` — what the current step draws, cumulative, computed FORWARD.
 *  - `region` — how many `Only:` steps are in force; 0 outside any replace.
 *
 * ```
 * displayed = tour ∪ tempHeld ∪ (region === 0 ? held : ∅)
 * ```
 *
 * **`Only:` — the one thing that subtracts.** Everything else adds. A replace
 * cannot DELETE the viewer's selection (`back` could not restore it, and
 * exiting would have eaten it), so it SUPPRESSES: `held` stops contributing
 * while `region > 0` and is otherwise untouched. `tempHeld` is NOT suppressed
 * — a class ticked during a replaced step stays on screen; `Only:` is about
 * clearing the canvas the tour built, not about fighting the viewer.
 *
 * **`held` returns at the crossing back to region 0, not at exit.** The rule is
 * *back into a step shows what that step showed*, and going forward a region-0
 * step displayed `held`. Waiting until exit would make region 0 the one region
 * whose suppression a pop does not lift.
 *
 * **Viewer edits.** A tick goes to whichever set is the viewer's right now:
 * `held` at region 0, `tempHeld` while a replace is in force. So a class ticked
 * both before and during a replace has TWO records, one in each — two ticks,
 * two facts, undone separately. (The tidier alternative, MOVING the id into
 * `tempHeld`, was rejected: `+A` then `−A` during a replace would then destroy
 * a class that was never on screen, and a cancelling pair of clicks must be a
 * no-op. See WORKLOG 2026-09-07.)
 *
 * An untick edits EVERY set currently DISPLAYING the class — usually just one,
 * but `tour` and `held` both display at region 0. Every set is editable, so an
 * untick always lands somewhere and the checkbox always stays off. What it does
 * NOT do is reach into a SUPPRESSED set: inside a replace `held` is off screen,
 * so an untick has not spoken to it and it returns at the crossing. See
 * `untick` for why "the first set holding it" is not the same rule.
 *
 * **A recorded step holds only the tour's half, and is cumulative.** It is a
 * snapshot of `tour` at the moment the step was pushed. The usual objection
 * to cumulative state — that a snapshot captures the viewer's selection too, so
 * `back` reinstates a tick they have since removed — does not apply, because
 * `held`/`tempHeld` live OUTSIDE the recorded steps and are composed in at read
 * time. That is what makes the untick rule free: an untick edits the live
 * `tour` and rewrites nothing, so a step recorded before it still shows what
 * it showed.
 *
 * `region` rides on the recorded step rather than being counted beside them, so
 * stepping back across a replace is a read (the previous step's region IS the
 * region to return to) rather than a decrement to get wrong.
 *
 * **What this replaced, and why.** The previous version kept `counts` (a
 * refcount whose number nothing ever read — every use was `counts.has(id)`) and
 * `displaced` (a per-frame snapshot of what a replace hid), and `reconcile`
 * rewrote every frame on a viewer untick to make it permanent. `displaced`
 * existed only because the viewer's half was DERIVED (selection minus what the
 * tour holds) rather than stored; storing it removes the snapshot's reason to
 * exist. The lesson worth keeping: **do not store two views of one fact** —
 * both bugs in this area were exactly that.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Worked example.** Siggie's trace, and the one place every rule meets: a
 * replace, ticks on both sides of it, a class with two records, unticks against
 * all three sets, and a `back` walk that crosses the region boundary. `Only:`
 * at state 5; viewer edits at 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11. The `t-step` column is the
 * recorded step (`region-step`) that the `back` rows read — note that the
 * viewer rows have none, because a viewer edit records nothing, which is why
 * `back` skips over them.

 * The recorded steps, which is what the `back` rows read:
 *
 * ```
 * 0-0: U          0-1: U,V
 * 1-0: C,W,X      1-1: W,X,Y      1-2: X,Y,Z
 * ```
 *
 * `1-0` holds `C` and `1-1` does not, without anything having removed it: `1-0`
 * was recorded at state 5 and `1-1` at state 8, with the untick at state 7 in
 * between. Likewise `W` survives in `1-1` and is absent from `1-2`. That is the
 * whole of why an untick needs no surgery on the recorded steps.
 *
 * Four rows to read against the untick rule:
 *
 *  - **4, `−B`** — `B` is in `held` at region 0, where `held` is displayed, so
 *    `held` gives it up. This is the case that makes `held` EDITABLE rather
 *    than frozen: the untick has to stick, or the checkbox bounces back.
 *  - **6, `+D,+E,+F`** — a tick during a replace goes to `temp_held`. `D` and
 *    `E` are ALSO in `held`, and the second record is deliberate.
 *  - **7, `−C`** — `C` is in `tour` and in `held`, but `held` is SUPPRESSED
 *    here, so only `tour` gives it up and `held` keeps its copy for the
 *    crossing.
 *  - **11, `−E`** — `E` is in `temp_held` and in `held`; `temp_held` is the one
 *    displaying it. So `E` is on screen again at `back to 0-1` and survives to
 *    exit. This is the only row where `back` reaches past the tour's own
 *    contribution into the viewer's, and it follows from the same rule: back
 *    into a step shows what that step showed, and `0-1` genuinely showed `E`.
 *
 * The table is pinned row by row in `tourStateStack.test.ts`, so it cannot
 * drift from the code. **One case it does not exercise**: every untick above
 * has exactly one DISPLAYING set, so none of them distinguishes "remove from
 * the first set holding it" from "remove from every set displaying it". Those
 * differ only at region 0, where `held` is not suppressed and a class can be
 * displayed by `tour` and `held` at once. See `untick`.
