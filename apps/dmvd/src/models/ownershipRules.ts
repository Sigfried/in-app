/**
 * **One declaration for every ownership rule and every edge kind.**
 *
 * Before this module the definition of a single rule was spread across five
 * unrelated places: a branch in `classifySlotEdgeExplained`, a hand-curated
 * `Set`, a string in `OWNERSHIP_RULE_TEXT`, an entry in `EDGE_STYLE.kinds`,
 * and a row in `RelationBar`'s `POSITION_AXIS`. Adding a rule meant editing
 * five files and hoping; adding an edge KIND meant editing more.
 *
 * Everything about a rule now lives in one entry of `OWNERSHIP_RULES`, and
 * everything about how its edge is drawn lives in one entry of
 * `OWNERSHIP_VERDICTS`. The old exports are projections of these, so nothing
 * downstream had to change.
 *
 * The acceptance criterion is below and pinned by `ownershipRules.test.ts`;
 * see docs/OWNERSHIP_CLASSIFICATION.md for what the rules MEAN, which is the
 * thing to read first.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **The acceptance criterion, and why it is written down here.**
 *
 * `association` — an edge kind that is dashed, arrowed at BOTH ends, claims no
 * ownership, and yet layers exactly like `own-bkwd` — must be expressible by
 * adding one entry to `OWNERSHIP_VERDICTS` and one to `OWNERSHIP_RULES`, and
 * touching nothing else. That is what makes it restorable from a specification
 * rather than from git history. Its rule entry is COMMENTED OUT at the foot of
 * `OWNERSHIP_RULES` rather than deleted; restoring it means uncommenting it
 * AND moving it to the front, because unlike an exception it defeats Rule 1
 * outright and so has to be reached first.
 *
 * It is the reason `claimsOwnership` and `layering` are separate fields: for
 * the two live kinds they are perfectly correlated, and a design that had only
 * ever seen those two would have collapsed them into one. `ownershipRules.test.ts`
 * proves the criterion by building the association entry and checking it
 * classifies and draws correctly.

 * for a number to carry — and `child-following-parent` is not a slot rule at
