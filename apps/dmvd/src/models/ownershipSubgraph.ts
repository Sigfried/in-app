/**
 * Ownership subgraph for the Explore viz (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, data layer).
 *
 * Takes the full classified ownership graph (models/containmentGraph) and a
 * selection, and returns the drawable subgraph per the content policy:
 * **nothing is drawn that was not selected.** Selected entities and the edges
 * among them, and that is all. What a node relates to but does not draw is
 * reported in `hiddenOwners` / `hiddenOwned` so the UI can offer it.
 *
 * **The automatic owner draw is gone (2026-08-27, Siggie).** Every selected
 * node used to pull in up to `DEFAULT_OWNER_CAP = 5` of its direct owners
 * unasked, so `sel=MeasurementObservation` drew SIX boxes and
 * `sel=BodySite~Participant` drew TEN. Ticking one checkbox has to draw one
 * box. The `ownerCap` option (`0 / ≤5 / all` in the toolbar) and the
 * `suppressedOwners` dismissal set both existed only to bound that automatic
 * draw, so removing it takes them with it: with nothing drawn unasked, there
 * is nothing to cap and nothing to dismiss that is not simply deselected.
 *
 * This also retires `expansions` as a separate input. Expanding IS selecting
 * now, so a class is on the canvas for exactly one reason and the
 * selected/expanded distinction — long complained about, deferred twice as too
 * risky — stops existing rather than needing to be tracked.
 *
 * pathToRoot defaults OFF. Ancestors fan OUT rather than up a spine: a value
 * object is owned by everything that stores one, and each of those owners
 * drags in its own path to root, so the walk is a reverse-reachability
 * closure. Measured against the live schema: selecting BodySite pulled 15
 * context nodes / 32 edges, and Quantity pulled 29 of the schema's 53 classes
 * with 87 edges — from a single checkbox. That also swamped expand-on-demand,
 * which assumes a small canvas you grow deliberately.
 *
 * Backbone: supergroup/dag — `fromEdges` builds the ownership DAG (cycle
 * edges demoted to backedges), `parents` gives the default one-hop owners
 * while `ancestors()` yields the opt-in paths-to-root, and
 * per-node `maxDepth` over the FULL DAG is the layer assignment, so a node
 * keeps its layer as the selection changes.
 *
 * Model-layer module: components reach it only through
 * DataService.getOwnershipSubgraph().
