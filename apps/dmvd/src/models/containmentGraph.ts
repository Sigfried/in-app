/**
 * Ownership graph derivation ("ownership" is the current term; this module
 * retains its historical "containment" naming until a broader rename).
 *
 * Produces the flat {nodes, edges} graph the ownership diagram consumes,
 * derived from the live SchemaGraph. Originally a TypeScript port of a pair of
 * Python prototypes (`scripts/extract_containment_tree.py` and
 * `extract_has_a_graph.py`, deleted 2026-09-05 — see git history); the rules
 * here have since been rewritten and are the only live implementation.
 *
 * Every class-ranged slot is classified with an OwnershipVerdict (see
 * `classifySlotEdge`). **The rules are declared in `./ownershipRules`** — one
 * ordered table holding each rule's predicate, verdict, human text and drawn
 * appearance — and re-exported below; this module applies them and builds the
 * graph. `is_a` relationships are emitted separately, as kind:"subclass" edges.
 *
 * `ASSOCIATION_SLOTS` is empty as of 2026-09-11, so no association edge is
 * produced from this schema. The category and its rendering are kept
 * deliberately — they are the worked example proving an edge kind is
 * expressible as configuration; see ownershipRules.ts's header.
 *
 * See docs/OWNERSHIP_CLASSIFICATION.md for every edge + rationale.
 *
 * This module is model-layer (it reads the SchemaGraph). Components reach it
 * only through DataService.getContainmentGraph().
