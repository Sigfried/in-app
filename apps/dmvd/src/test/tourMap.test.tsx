/**
 * The tour map — the outline panel behind the ⊞ on the popover's counter line
 * and behind the chooser's `Overview` row.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the thing a reader of `TourMap.tsx` would most
 * reasonably get wrong: the map lists STEPS, but `goToStep` takes an index
 * into POSITIONS, which are beat-level. A ten-beat step is eleven positions,
 * so a map built naively off the array index jumps to the wrong place — and
 * silently, because every index is valid.
