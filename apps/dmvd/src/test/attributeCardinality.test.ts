/**
 * Every attribute row carries a cardinality, drawn or not.
 *
 * The ownership view showed cardinality only on rows backed by a drawn edge,
 * because the label was attached to edges and `getClassSummary` re-parsed the
 * rendered Attributes table — which prints required/multivalued as 'Yes'/'No'
 * and so dropped the booleans. Scalar- and enum-ranged attributes are never
 * drawn, so they showed a blank cardinality forever; `Document.url` is `1..*`
 * and read as though it had no cardinality at all.
 *
 * Cardinality is a fact about the attribute, not about whether the row happens
 * to be connected to something, so it comes from the model now.
