/**
 * Drag pins are dropped on every relayout.
 *
 * A pin is an offset from where ELK put a box, so it is meaningful only against
 * the arrangement it was measured in. Once ELK re-runs, the same dx/dy displaces
 * the box from a position that no longer exists.
 *
 * Siggie's rule, 2026-09-09: *"other than zoom/pan and dragging other boxes, i
 * can't think of any canvas change that should hold on to pins."* Both of those
 * leave `layout` untouched — zoom is a wrapper transform that bypasses React,
 * and a drag feeds `placed`, never `spec` — so keying the clear on `layout` says
 * exactly that.
 *
 * ⚠️ Structural, not behavioural, and that is a real limit. Reaching this through
 * a render means running ELK, which does not run in jsdom (docs/TESTING.md), so
 * there is no way here to drag a box and assert where it lands. What this can do
 * is pin the DEPENDENCY, which is the whole content of the fix: `pins` used to
 * clear on `subgraph` (selection only), which held pins across LR↔TB, the
 * siblings toggle, expand/collapse and merge mode — all of which move every box.
