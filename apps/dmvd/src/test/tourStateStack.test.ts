 * Tour state on the `held`/`temp_held` model (Siggie 2026-09-07). The model is
 * documented in `tourStateStack.ts`'s header; how it was arrived at, and the one
 * case its design note got wrong, are in WORKLOG 2026-09-07.
 *
 * Two models preceded it. The first made every step a FULL absolute query
 * applied with `url.search = query`, so the tour had to snapshot and restore
 * the viewer's state, a mid-tour edit was clobbered, and any field a step did
 * not name snapped back to its default. The second made steps additive deltas
 * on a refcounted stack, which fixed all three but derived the viewer's half
 * (selection minus what the tour holds) instead of storing it — and so needed a
 * per-frame `displaced` snapshot and whole-stack surgery on an untick.
 *
 * Here both halves are stored. The tests below are organised around the four
 * things that buys: the composition, viewer edits landing in a named set,
 * `back` as a plain read, and exit as a read of the viewer's half.
