/**
 * Box height is DETERMINISTIC — the fix behind replacing the chip strips.
 *
 * The strips were `flex-wrap`: the browser decided how many lines they took,
 * while the height was ESTIMATED IN JS from label widths so ELK had a number up
 * front. The two necessarily disagreed on some boxes, and where the estimate
 * was low the rows below overlapped the chips. Observation was the worst case
 * (13 owner chips over three wrapped lines).
 *
 * The estimate is gone: the relation band is one fixed line whatever the count,
 * so height is a pure function of the row count. These assert that from the
 * outside — no internal constants imported — so the invariant survives a
 * change to any of the individual sizes. It would break the moment anyone
 * reintroduced a band whose height is measured from text.
