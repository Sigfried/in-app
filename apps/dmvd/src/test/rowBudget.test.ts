/**
 * What a COLLAPSED box shows.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-28 the rule was "only the connected rows" — the ones with an
 * edge. That hid too much: Person has nine attributes and one of them
 * (`cause_of_death`) is entity-ranged, so a collapsed Person was a single row
 * plus `+ 8 more attributes`, a box that said almost nothing about the class it
 * names (Siggie, screenshot). Collapsing exists to cap TALL boxes, so it should
 * cap them and leave short ones alone.
 *
 * **As of 2026-09-04 the budget is `Infinity`** — every box shows every
 * attribute and the footer never renders (Siggie: "just show all without that
 * link for now"). The budget code stays in place for the planned user
 * preference ("Default to show top [6] attributes"), so these tests keep
 * guarding it: a short box getting a footer it does not need, a long box not
 * being capped, and a connected row being cut — which matters beyond looks,
 * because an edge that arrives at a row the box is not drawing has no anchor
 * to point at.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT importing ROW_BUDGET: a test that reads the constant it is
 * checking passes for any value of it, including a wrong one. The numbers here
 * are written out, so changing the budget makes a test fail and asks whether
 * the new value is intended — which is exactly what happened when the budget
 * went to Infinity.
