/**
 * The `Guided tours` button and its chooser popover (docs/tasks.md item 2).
 *
 * Three things are pinned, and only the first is about the widget:
 *
 *  1. The chooser lists every tour the content file declares, with the
 *     description from its `TourMetadata:` block, and picking one starts THAT
 *     tour.
 *  2. `startTour` is reached WITH THE TOUR'S NAME. Before 2026-09-05 it took no
 *     argument and the provider navigated `tourPositions(content)` with no
 *     name, so only the first tour in the file could ever run — a second tour
 *     parsed cleanly, passed every content test, and was unreachable. A test
 *     that only checked "startTour was called" would not have caught it.
 *  3. Every help-only entry still has a way in, now that the Help menu is the
 *     only route to one.
