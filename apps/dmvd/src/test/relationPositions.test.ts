/**
 * The five relation positions behind the cascading menu that replaced the chip
 * strips (docs/TASKS.md, "Chip strips → relation counts + menu").
 *
 * The distinction under test is the one Siggie insisted on and the DAG erases:
 *
 *   > "i'm not sure i'm happy with the new hiddenOwned getting merged with
 *      owns. the distinction is sort of like 'mine because i say so' and 'mine
 *      because it says so'."
 *
 * `containmentGraph` flips own-bkwd edges at build time, so a DAG node's
 * parents/children carry direction only. `collectRelations` recovers the
 * declaring side from the FULL edge list, which still has `flipped`.
