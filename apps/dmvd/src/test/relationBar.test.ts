/**
 * The `←─ N   M ─→` bar's two axes, pinned against the real schema.
 *
 * These exist because the two axes were conflated repeatedly while the bar was
 * being designed (2026-09-04), in both directions, by both of us. They are
 * genuinely independent and the confusion is cheap to re-introduce:
 *
 *   SIDE  — which way the class sits on the canvas. Layout is owner-first, so
 *           everything that OWNS me is drawn to my left and everything I own
 *           to my right. This is what the two chip counts split on.
 *   KIND  — the edge's verdict, i.e. which end carries the arrowhead, i.e.
 *           which class declares the slot. This is what each ROW's little
 *           edge sample shows.
 *
 * The trap is assuming these are the same fact, which would make the row
 * samples redundant with the heading. They are not: BOTH kinds appear on BOTH
 * sides, and the tests below assert exactly that on real classes.
