/**
 * Entity category definitions for the Entity Explorer view.
 *
 * Categories are hand-curated groupings of BDCHM classes.
 *
 * **A class MAY appear in more than one category** (since 2026-09-04).
 * Categories don't live in the schema — they are imposed to make the app
 * easier to navigate — so a second listing is a navigation aid, NOT a second
 * superclass and not sibling merging.
 *
 * Three classes are dual-listed today. `SpecimenQualityObservation` and
 * `SpecimenQuantityObservation` sit under both `observation` and `lab`:
 * without the `observation` listing the only route to them was clicking a
 * Specimen row on the canvas, which left the Observation hierarchy looking
 * like it had three children instead of five. `BodySite` sits under both
 * `clinical` and `lab` — anatomy belongs to both (3 clinical uses against 1
 * lab, but usage counts are not the test).
 *
 * `DUAL_LISTED` in `entityCategories.test.ts` is the live list; trust it over
 * this comment.
 *
 * Dual-listing is an ALLOWLIST, not a free-for-all: `entityCategories.test.ts`
 * fails on an undeclared duplicate, and on an allowlisted class that is not
 * actually listed twice. Add to `DUAL_LISTED` there when adding a listing.
 *
 * Consumers walk categories → classes; the reverse (class → its categories)
 * exists nowhere. `getCategorySelectorSection` counts DISTINCT classes and
 * qualifies its item ids by category so two listings do not collide, while
 * selection keys off the bare class id so both rows toggle together.

  /**
   * Classes from OTHER categories drawn alongside the members in this
   * category's content view (the `⊞` control on the category header).
   * (`▶` was the drafted glyph; it collided — see `SelectionTable.tsx`.)
   *
   * **Not `NESTED_TABULAR_DEFAULT_PINS`.** That constant, below, is the unrelated
   * first-visit canvas selection. Same word, different feature.
   *
   * **The test for a pin is explanatory, not structural** (Siggie,
   * 2026-09-04). An earlier draft derived pins mechanically — every outside
   * class a member's slot points at, so no row was left drawing a hollow dot
   * — and it was rejected:
   *
   *   "I 'pinned' Person, Participant, Visit to Clinical because that
   *    category doesn't make sense without them. Do NOT pin
   *    TimePoint/TimePeriod to Admin. It clutters up the diagram and gives it
   *    no additional explanatory value."
   *
   * A hollow dot is an acceptable outcome, not a defect: the row still reads
   * `→ TimePoint 0..1`, which says everything the drawn edge would. The rule
   * of thumb: **value types are not pinned** (TimePoint, TimePeriod,
   * Quantity, Context are things attributes hold); **actors and contexts are**
   * (Participant, Visit, Person) when the records are records OF them.
   * `BodySite` is the near-miss — it looks like a value type but carries
   * domain content, and "where on the body" is part of what a measurement IS
   * — so it is pinned where used. Size is not the test.
   *
   * ⚠️ Hand-curated, and it rots on an upstream schema sync exactly like
   * `classIds` and the `containmentGraph` override sets — but INVISIBLY,
   * since a stale pin just draws one extra box rather than failing. Re-read
   * this comment after a sync; do not re-derive by query.
