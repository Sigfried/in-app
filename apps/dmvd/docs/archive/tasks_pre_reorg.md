# Tasks

## 🚨 URGENT - Demo Fixes (4 hours)

[sg]
- amazingly we got the dom-based-link-overlay branch working well enough -- two minutes before
  the call!! -- that i was able to use it for most of the demo. it still has lots of bugs and
  i have no idea how much of a mess was made in the last few days as we were scrambling to get
  ready for the demo.
- now we should try to work systematically on
  1. organizing and streamlining the planning docs
  2. refactoring model and UI the way i want it
  3. fixing bugs
  4. adding features
- let's now have what i expect to be a long and maybe frustrating interactive work session
  on 1 -- in which we will figure out what to do with 2-4
  - maybe we should begin by writing you instructions for how we want the doc/planning 
    process and output to work and how we should conduct the interactive work session
  - some initial inputs
    - there are already so many instructions in so many places that you often seem to ignore
      a lot of them. a goal is to pare those down into something you can really digest and 
      stick to in every claude code session and how to handle more task-related instructions
      and new global instructions
    - the order of upcoming tasks is prone to change a lot as we hit various blocks or have
      new realizations. so let's try to do plan documentation with that in mind
      - numbering of tasks and architecture points (etc) has been a pain. i'm not sure
        how to make that flow better
    - we should work on having a planning/documentation/implementation process that you can
      really stick to, which we have not been able to do previously
      - i like that so much of our work has been captured in progress.md, and once in a while
        we consult that doc to understand what's been done or not. but for the most part i
        doubt anyone will ever read it. and it has really cost a lot of time reminding you
        to archive stuff there and remove it from active planning documents.maybe we should
        drop it
      - a process you can stick to might be something like:
        - plan first, implement after solidifying and approving plans
        - commit after basically everything
        - i want you to be fresh and alert, so we should have a plan for clearing/compacting context
          - warn me when there's less than 60% context remaining
          - tell me when there's good reason to continue without clearing, but don't argue for
            continuing just because you think you have plenty of room
          - prepare for each clear by making sure that docs have the information you need to
            continue after clearing and give me a brief instruction to give back to you telling
            you when to start back up. make sure everything is committed before i clear
          - take frequent pauses to re-streamline planning docs
          - maybe have an archive directory so we can purge planning info frequently without
            worrying about losing it, but purging anything we don't need (in docs and code)
            is super important to prevent confusion for both of us
            - perhaps: have an archive version of each active doc and every time something is
              complete or no longer relevant, delete it and move it to the end of that file.
              i don't know if this will be much easier than what we've been doing (or failing
              to do) with progress.md
        - could we possibly keep the docs short enough that we don't need TOCs? if not, do a better
          job of maintaining them
    - for the interactive doc/planning session you should
      - walk as systematically as possible through all the current plans and ideas scattered
        amongst doc files and code comments and ask me if they are still relevant and what
        to do with them
- upcoming tasks that are at the top of my mind right now (besides what i just described)
  - deciding whether to merge dom-based-link-overlay into main right away or not
  - merging the two Element files
  - documenting current bugs
  - switching to the new EdgeInfo type
  - deleting unused code and better organizing code that remains

### ✅ Completed Quick Fixes (Round 1)

1. **✅ FIXED: Right panel cut off in 3-panel mode**
   - **Issue**: Stacked mode threshold didn't account for middle panel width + 2 gutters
   - **Fix**: Updated `calculateRemainingSpace()` to include `middlePanelVisible` parameter
   - **Files**: `utils/layoutHelpers.ts`, `components/LayoutManager.tsx`

2. **✅ FIXED: Hover boxes spilling over right edge of viewport**
   - **Issue**: X position calculated but not clamped to viewport width
   - **Fix**: Added `Math.min(idealX, maxX)` to prevent overflow
   - **Files**: `components/RelationshipInfoBox.tsx:88-93`

3. **✅ FIXED: No links to types (Round 2 - proper fix)**
   - **Issue 1**: Types weren't included in `computeIncomingRelationships()` check ✅
   - **Issue 2**: `categorizeRange()` was treating types as primitives, preventing link creation
   - **Fix**: Changed return type to include `'type'` and removed special case treating types as primitives
   - **Files**: `models/ElementPreRefactor.ts:621,132`

4. **✅ FIXED: Hover box z-index lower than detail boxes**
    - **Issue**: RelationshipInfoBox had `z-50`, FloatingBoxManager had `z-40`
    - **Fix**: Increased hover box to `z-[60]` so it appears above detail boxes
    - **Files**: `components/RelationshipInfoBox.tsx:283,307`

5. two-panel bugs
   1. **Class→class links going left→left instead of left→right [sg] fixed
6. three-panel bugs
   1. **class-->slot links pointing wrong direction**
   2. **no slot-->class (right panel) links** [sg] fixed
   - [sg] pseudocode for generating links: -- actually, trying to write this in LinkOverlay.tsx

      ```typescript
      for (panel of displayedPanels) {
        panelId: 'left-panel' | 'middle-panel' | 'right_panel' = panel.id
        for (section of panel.sections) {
          for (item of section) {
            
          }
        }
      }
      ```
   
   3. [sg] Specimen-->analyte_type link missing ![img_1.png](img_1.png)
7. both modes bugs
   1. **no link highlight on item hover**
   2. **Slot hover "No relationships found"**

### After Demo: Documentation & Structure Cleanup

#### Relevant Documentation Files (prioritized)
1. **TASKS.md** (this file) - Keep, update with post-demo work
2. **UI_REFACTOR.md** - Keep, primary UI work tracking
3. **REFACTOR_PLAN.md** - Keep, completed architecture documentation
4. **PROGRESS.md** - Keep, historical record
5. **CLAUDE.md** - Keep, development principles
6. **TWO_GRAPH_ANALYSIS.md** - Review after demo, may inform future work
7. **LINKOVERLAY_REFACTOR_PLAN_v2.md** - Keep for LinkOverlay work

#### Obsolete Files to Delete
- [ ] ELEMENT_MERGE_ANALYSIS.md (obsoleted by two-graph decision)
  - [sg] we talked about a two-graph idea, but i don't think we decided. it needs more discussion
- [ ] ELEMENTPREREFACTOR_RETIREMENT_PLAN.md (obsoleted by two-graph decision)
  - no, it's obsoleted by our decision to merge Element.ts back into ElementPreRefactor.ts and rename it 
    back to Element.ts, and then fix the many problems in place. i think there are instructions for that
    somewhere
- [ ] COMPONENT_FLOW.md (if exists, check first)
- [ ] DATA_FLOW.md (check if obsolete)
- [ ] Item.ts (check if exists)
- [ ] Any other pre-refactor analysis files

## Questions & Decisions Needed

### DetailContent.test.tsx Failures (19 tests)

**Status**: Pre-existing issue (broken since mid-November 2025)

**Investigation results** (2025-01-18):
- Last passing: Commit `4d32ec5` (Phase 11: Create FloatingBoxManager and rename DetailPanel)
- First failing: Commit `3021513` (Revert "refactor: Set up DataService infrastructure for Slots-as-Edges (Stage 2)")
- Root cause: DataService refactor was reverted, breaking test setup
- **Not related to Stage 3 (Slots-as-Edges) work**

**Current test status**:
- ✅ 163 tests passing (up from 143 before fixes)
- ❌ 19 tests failing in DetailContent.test.tsx only
- All other test failures fixed (targetType→targetSection terminology changes)

**Action needed**: Fix DetailContent test setup to work with current DataService structure. Low priority - doesn't block current refactor work.

---

## Architecture & Refactoring Decisions

**📌 [ARCHIVED TO PROGRESS.md]**
- All quick wins completed and archived in Phase 13
- Core architecture now documented in REFACTOR_PLAN.md (Slots-as-Edges with graph model)
- Implementation plan integrated with prerequisite: "Improve Schema Data Loading and Validation" below

### Different Variable Treatment for Condition and Drug Exposure Classes 

<details>
<summary><b>conversation about this</b></summary>

from [Slack model-plus-variable-documentation](https://dmc-cmm6947.slack.com/archives/C09KGAWNQDD/p1762286966749659)

> **Anne**: I think I made a mistake by calling "asthma" and "angina" variables. BMI is a variable that is a Measurement observation. We can think of BMI as a column in a spreadsheet. We wouldn't have a column for "asthma" - we would have a column for conditions with a list of mondo codes for the conditions present. This becomes more important when we are talking about the "heart failure" and "heart disease" columns. Where does one draw lines? The division of conditions into variables/columns might be ok if all we're looking at is asthma and angina, but quickly gets too hard to draw lines.

> **Siggie**: So, should those variables appear in the variable specs at all? If so, how should we represent them? And are there other variables in the specs that need special treatment or don't belong?

> **Anne**: I think they should appear, just differently. Perhaps as a list? maybe a layered donut? I think DrugExposures will need to be depicted in the same way

> **Siggie**:
    what should i call these things if not variables?
    layered donut? sounds tasty, but i'm not sure how it would work.
    do we have additional documentation for any of these that we would want to include? like we could set up Angina to link to angina_prior_1 if that would be appropriate

> **Anne**:
    You can call them Conditions and Drug Exposures for now
    I think for angina, we would want a link to the URI

> **Siggie**:
    where would i get the URI?

> **Anne**:
  I would recommend harvesting all the mondo and hpo curies out of the transform files

> **Siggie**:
> you're talking about [these yaml files](https://github.com/RTIInternational/NHLBI-BDC-DMC-HV/tree/main/priority_variables_transform)?
> 
> so for Atrial fibrillation:
>   - manually map it to what it's called in the yaml file names, afib
>   - find all the mondo URIs in those files, maybe just one unique one: MONDO:0004981
>   - there don't seem to be any hpo URIs
>   - generate a link to it (which I thought I knew how to do using the prefix from bdchm.yaml:
>     MONDO: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_, but I don't, though I'm sure it's not hard)
>
>  did i get that right?

> **Anne**:
> yes, but you won't really see much difference until you look at something more generic, like heart disease.
i think hypertension uses an HPO CURIE

> **Siggie**:
> i think we decided i can focus on the model for now and then when that's stable, can move to a richer
  interface for variables. ok if i just give myself a reminder to come back to this discussion then?

#### [sg] resolution:
when displaying these or maybe other groups of variables (e.g., Procedure), show
a message like:

> These <Condition|DrugExposure|etc.> variables were used in the pilot. There are potentially thousands of <
> Condition|etc.>s that can appear in actual data. They won't be handled as specific variables but as <...> records in the
> harmonized data

## Next Up (Ordered)

### UI Component Refactoring 🎨 ACTIVE

**Status**: ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS** - Model/architecture refactor complete, UI needs updates

**Goal**: Update UI components to work correctly with graph-based model and three-panel layout

**See [UI_REFACTOR.md](UI_REFACTOR.md) for detailed component-by-component breakdown.**

**High Priority** (blocking demo):
1. **LinkOverlay 3-panel display** - Links not rendering correctly when middle panel visible
2. **Hover box fixes** - RelationshipInfoBox broken for slots, possibly types
3. **Transform schema optimization** - Exclude unused types to reduce bundle size

**Medium Priority**:
4. **Detail box slot edges** - Not rendering clickable slot edges
5. **Floating box manager** - Cascade positioning bugs
6. **Grouped slots panel** - Design complete, needs implementation

**Lower Priority**:
7. **LayoutManager enhancements** - Misc improvements
8. **Type filtering** - Only show types actually used in schema

---

### Documentation Cleanup 📚 TODO

**Status**: TODO - Archive refactor work and update docs

**Goal**: Update documentation to reflect completed Slots-as-Edges architecture.

**Updates needed**:
- ✅ REFACTOR_PLAN.md - Marked complete, points to UI_REFACTOR (done)
- ✅ PROGRESS.md - Archived Stages 1-5 as Phase 17 (done)
- ⏭️ CLAUDE.md - Add graph model patterns, SlotEdge architecture
- ⏭️ DATA_FLOW.md - Update for Slots-as-Edges and graphology
- ⏭️ TASKS.md - Remove obsolete items (this file)

<a id="detailrefactor"></a>
### Unified Detail Box System - Remaining Work

**Context**: Steps 0-3 completed, Step 4 partially complete. Core functionality working but some bugs and enhancements remain.

**Completed**: FloatingBoxManager component, DataService abstraction, hover positioning, cascade algorithm, architecture violations fixed

**Remaining issues** (from Step 4):

1. **Hover positioning** (⚠️ minor)
   - Working but not centered on item (appears near top)
   - Expected: Box should center vertically on hovered item
   - Check RelationshipInfoBox.tsx positioning logic

2. **Refactor UI to use itemId instead of type** (⭐ priority)
   - Problem: UI layer using `type` field violates view/model separation
   - ItemHoverData has `type` field (Section.tsx:22)
   - LinkOverlay compares `link.source.type === hoveredItem.type`
   - Solution: Change to use `itemId` for identity throughout UI layer

3. **Remove unnecessary isStacked logic** (enhancement)
   - All boxes should be draggable regardless of display mode
   - displayMode only affects initial positioning, not capabilities

4. **Make stacked width responsive** (enhancement)
   - Currently fixed at 600px
   - Should calculate based on available space after panels

5. **Move box management logic to FloatingBoxManager** (refactor)
   - App.tsx currently handles array management, duplicate detection, bring-to-front
   - Should move to FloatingBoxManager for better encapsulation

6. **Fix transitory/persistent box upgrade architecture** (enhancement)
   - Current: Creates new box on upgrade, causing position jump
   - Should: Modify existing RelationshipInfoBox mode from transitory → persistent

7. **Hover/upgrade behavior broken** (❌ critical)
   - App.tsx:155 creates DetailContent instead of RelationshipInfoBox on upgrade
   - RelationshipInfoBox uses fixed positioning which conflicts with FloatingBox wrapper
   - Fix: Refactor RelationshipInfoBox to support both transitory and persistent modes

8. **Cascade positioning - boxes stacking incorrectly** (❌ bug)
   - Non-user-positioned boxes appear on top of each other in wrong place
   - Note: URL restoration positioning IS working correctly
   - Code location: FloatingBoxManager.tsx:148-194

9. **Delete old components** (cleanup)
   - Delete DetailDialog.tsx
   - Delete DetailPanelStack.tsx

10. **Update tests** (testing)
    - Test relationship box upgrade flow
    - Test multiple relationship boxes
    - Test mixed content types (relationship + detail boxes)

**For detailed implementation history**, see full "Unified Detail Box System" section in git history (search for "Unified Detail Box System Quick Navigation" comment).

## Future UI Improvements

Tasks moved here during Slots-as-Edges refactor documentation consolidation. These will be revisited after Stage 6 completes.

### LinkOverlay Refactor ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION FOR SLOTS-AS-EDGES

**Status**: Implementation plan needs updating for Slots-as-Edges architecture

**Original goal**: Eliminate nested loops and type awareness from LinkOverlay. Will need revision once slots become edges.

See REFACTOR_PLAN.md Stage 4 for how this fits into three-panel layout with slot edge traversal.

---

<a id="abstract-tree"></a>
### Abstract Tree Rendering System

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting, give tour of current tree rendering, fully specify interface, write production code inline first before extracting.

**Goal**: Extract tree rendering and expansion logic from Element into reusable abstractions

**Benefits**:
- Consistent tree UX across Elements panel and info boxes
- Easier to add new tree-based displays
- Centralizes expansion logic
- Could support multiple tree layouts (simple indented, tabular with sections)

full task description (recovered from [old TASKS.md](https://github.com/Sigfried/dynamic-model-var-docs/blob/df062529ab5268030d10f90a84080d6c1109bbec/docs/TASKS.md#abstract-tree-rendering-system)):

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting this refactor:
1. Give a tour of how tree rendering currently works (Element tree structure, expansion state, rendering in components)
2. Fully specify the interface (how it's used in practice, not just TypeScript definitions)
3. Write actual production code directly in component files to verify the design
4. Wrap this code in closures or make it inactive until ready to replace existing code
5. Once abstraction is complete, remove old code and activate new code

**Goal**: Extract tree rendering and expansion logic from Element into reusable abstractions that can be shared between Elements panel and info boxes (and future tree-like displays).

**Why this matters**: Converting DetailContent and other components to use this system should result in significant simplification.

**Current state**:
- Element class has tree capabilities (parent, children, traverse, ancestorList)
- Expansion state managed by useExpansionState hook
- Tree rendering handled in each component (Section.tsx, DetailPanel, etc.)
- Info box data could be hierarchical but isn't structured that way yet

**Proposed abstraction**:
- Create parent class or mixin with tree capabilities
  - Node relationships (parent, children, siblings)
  - Tree traversal (depth-first, breadth-first)
  - Expansion state management
  - **Layout logic** (not just expansion - how trees are rendered)
- Element becomes a child of this abstraction
- Info box data structures as tree nodes
- Shared rendering components/hooks

**Benefits**:
- Consistent tree UX across Elements panel and info boxes
- Could switch between tree layouts (simple indented tree, tabular tree with sections)
- Easier to add new tree-based displays
- Centralizes expansion logic

**Tree layout options** (switch in code, not necessarily in UI):
- **Simple tree**: Current indented style with expand/collapse arrows
- **Tabular tree**: Hierarchical table with columns (see Slots Table Optimization example)
  - Indented rows show hierarchy
  - Expandable sections
  - Can show properties in columns
- **Sectioned tree**: Groups with headers, nested content

**Related**: Slots Table Optimization task (Detail Panel Enhancements) shows hierarchical table example from another app - tree structure with indented rows, expandable sections, multiple columns. Info box inherited slots could use this pattern.

**Note**: If helpful during implementation, the hierarchical table screenshot can be copied to `docs/images/` for reference.

**Implementation approach**:
1. Give tour of current tree rendering system
2. Design tree abstraction (class? mixin? hooks?)
3. Extract expansion state management
4. Extract layout logic
5. Refactor Element to use abstraction
6. Apply to info box data structures
7. Consider tabular tree layout for slots tables

**Files likely affected**:
- `src/models/Element.ts` - Extract tree logic
- `src/models/TreeNode.ts` or `TreeBase.ts` (new) - Tree abstraction
- `src/hooks/useExpansionState.ts` - Possibly generalize
- `src/components/Section.tsx` - Use abstraction
- `src/components/RelationshipInfoBox.tsx` - Structure data as tree
- `src/components/DetailPanel.tsx` - Use abstraction for slots table

---

### Detail Panel Enhancements

**Enum Detail Improvements**:
- Enums have either permissible values OR instructions for getting values from elsewhere (`reachable_from` field)
- Will need to load prefixes to link to external ontologies

**Slots Table Optimization**:
- Slot order not currently correct - inherited slots should be at top
- Use Abstract Tree Rendering System (once implemented) to group slots by ancestor
- Each group becomes a collapsible tree node

See full task description in Future Work section for details.

---

## Upcoming Features

### App Configuration File

**Goal**: Centralize hard-coded constants into a single configuration file for easier maintenance and tuning

**Current state**: Constants scattered throughout components
- RelationshipInfoBox.tsx: hover debounce (300ms), linger duration (1.5s), upgrade time (1.5s)
- Various components: type-related colors (blue/purple/green/orange)
- Other hard-coded values: spacing, sizes, thresholds

**Design consideration**: Allow values to be expressed as functions or constants
- Simple constants for fixed values (e.g., `hoverDebounce: 300`)
- Functions for calculated values (e.g., `getMaxHeight: () => window.innerHeight * 0.8`)
- Helps developers find both constant and calculated values in one place

**Create**: `src/config/appConfig.ts`

**Constants to centralize**:
```typescript
export const APP_CONFIG = {
  // Timing constants (milliseconds)
  timing: {
    hoverDebounce: 300,      // Delay before showing preview on hover
    lingerDuration: 1500,    // How long preview stays after unhover
    upgradeHoverTime: 1500,  // Hover duration to upgrade preview to persistent box
  },

  // Element type colors
  colors: {
    class: 'blue',
    enum: 'purple',
    slot: 'green',
    variable: 'orange',
  },

  // UI thresholds
  thresholds: {
    collapsibleListSize: 20,  // Show "...N more" for lists over this size
    collapsedPreviewCount: 10, // How many items to show when collapsed
  },

  // Add other constants as discovered
};
```

**Files to update**:
- `src/components/RelationshipInfoBox.tsx` - Import timing constants
- `src/components/DetailContent.tsx` - Import color constants
- `src/components/Section.tsx` - Import color constants
- Other component files using hard-coded colors/values

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for tuning behavior
- Easier to experiment with different timing values
- Prepares for future user preferences/settings
- Documents significant constants in one place

---

### Fix Dark Mode Display Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Fix readability issues in dark mode
**Importance**: High - app currently unusable in dark mode

**Issues from screenshot**:
- Poor contrast/readability throughout
- Need to audit all color combinations

**Files likely affected**:
- `src/index.css` - Tailwind dark mode classes
- All component files using colors
---

### User Help Documentation

**Goal**: Create comprehensive user help system

**Approach**:
1. Start composing help content in a markdown file (before adding to app UI)
2. Begin with content from README.md "For Users" section (after TOC)
3. Focus on features that might not be obvious or could be confusing
4. Review PROGRESS.md for additional material to include

**UI Integration** (after content is ready):
- Opens in FloatingBox
- Full help: Large box with table of contents
- Contextual help: Opens to relevant section (scrolled into view)
- Can open entire help with section highlighted
---

## Future Work

### Relationship Info Box Enhancements (deferred from Phase 10)

- **Bi-directional preview**: Hovering over element names in info box highlights them in tree panels
- **"Explore relationship" action**: Open both elements side-by-side for comparison
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys, Enter, Tab for navigating within info box
- **Quick filter toggles**: Filter relationships by type (show/hide inheritance, slots, variables, etc.)

---
### selfRefs
links from an item to itself were supposed to be little loops instead of crossing panels

### Merge TESTING.md Files

**Background**: TESTING.md was copied to root and diverged from docs/TESTING.md

**Files**:
- `TESTING.root-snapshot-2025-11-03.md` (4.6k) - Newer, condensed, Phase 6.4+ testing patterns
- `docs/TESTING.md` (17k) - Older, comprehensive testing documentation

**Task**: Merge the newer Phase 6.4+ content into the comprehensive docs/TESTING.md, then delete snapshot

---

### Split Element.ts into Separate Files

**Current state**: Element.ts is 919 lines with 4 element classes + 4 collection classes

**Target structure** (keep element class with its collection class in same file):
- `models/Element.ts` (base Element and ElementCollection classes)
- `models/ClassElement.ts` (ClassElement + ClassCollection)
- `models/EnumElement.ts` (EnumElement + EnumCollection)
- `models/SlotElement.ts` (SlotElement + SlotCollection)
- `models/VariableElement.ts` (VariableElement + VariableCollection)
- `models/index.ts` (barrel export)

**Benefits**:
- Each element/collection pair stays together (easier to maintain)
- Smaller, more focused files
- Easier to understand each element type in isolation

---

### Overhaul Badge Display System

**Goal**: Make badges more informative and clear about what counts they represent

**Current problems**:
- Badges show single counts (enum values, slot usage, variable count) but it's unclear what they mean
- Users might want to see multiple counts per element (e.g., class shows variable count but not enum/slot counts)
- No labels on badges - just numbers in colored pills

**Potential improvements**:
- Multi-badge display: Show multiple counts per element (e.g., "103 vars, 5 enums, 2 slots")
- Badge labels or tooltips: Make it clear what each number represents
- Configurable: Let users choose which counts to display
- Contextual: Different badge types for different views

**Implementation approach TBD** - Need to design before implementing

**Files likely affected**:
- `src/models/Element.ts` - Replace simple `getBadge(): number` with richer badge info
- `src/components/Section.tsx` - Render multiple badges or labeled badges
- `src/models/RenderableItem.ts` - Update badge field to support richer info

---

### Search and Filter

**Potential importance**: High - major usability feature for exploring large schemas

**Search functionality**:
- Search bar with full-text search across all elements
- Highlight search results in tree/sections
- Quick navigation: search results open in new dialogs

**Filter controls**:
- Checkboxes for class families
- Variable count slider
- Relationship type toggles

---

### Neighborhood Zoom

**Potential importance**: Medium - useful for focused exploration

**Focus mode**:
- Show only k-hop neighborhood around selected element
- Relationship type filters ("show only `is_a` relationships" vs "show associations")
- Breadcrumb trail showing navigation path
- "Reset to full view" button

---

### Enhanced Element Metadata Display

Show additional relationship counts in tree view:
- **Current**: Only variable count (e.g., "Condition (20)")
- **Desired**: "Condition (20 vars, 5 enums, 2 classes, 1 slot)"

---

### Custom Preset Management

User-managed presets replacing hard-coded ones:
- Save Preset button → prompts for name
- Saves current panel configuration (sections + dialogs) to localStorage
- Display saved presets in header with remove icons

### Advanced Overview

Multiple view modes and analytics:
- Tree view (current)
- Network view (force-directed graph for associations)
- Matrix view (class-enum usage heatmap)
- Mini-map showing current focus area
- Statistics dashboard

### Terminology Consistency

**Goal**: Use consistent terminology throughout app
**Importance**: Low - internal consistency improvement

**Problem**: Still using "Property" to denote attributes and slots

**Action needed**:
- Use "Attribute" and "Slot" consistently
- Document terminology guidelines to prevent regression

**Terminology guidelines**:
- ✅ **Attribute** or **Slot** - NOT "Property"
- ✅ **Element** - NOT "Entity" (entity was old term)
- ✅ **Class**, **Enum**, **Slot**, **Variable** - Capitalize when referring to element types

**Terminology configuration**:
- It might be better for some people to see "<current class> is_a <base class>" and other people to see "<current class> inherits from <base class>". Allow that to be a (probably) user-configurable option.
- I don't know how software with internationalization capabilities handle this, or with configurable display themes, but we could try similar approaches.

### External Link Integration

**Goal**: Link prefixed IDs to external sites (OMOP, DUO, etc.)

**Implementation**:
- Use prefix data from bdchm.yaml
- Make CURIEs clickable in variable details
- Add tooltip showing full URL before clicking

### Feature Parity with Official Docs

Reference: https://rtiinternational.github.io/NHLBI-BDC-DMC-HM/

Missing features:
1. **Types** - Import and display linkml:types
2. **Dynamic enums** - Show which enums are dynamic
3. **LinkML Source** - Collapsible raw LinkML view
4. **Direct and Induced** - Show direct vs inherited slots
5. **Partial ERDs** - Visual relationship diagrams

#### Future: Graph-based Model Architecture (Major Refactor)

**Status**: Design idea only - not implementing yet

**Proposal** (from [DATA_FLOW.md discussion](../docs/DATA_FLOW.md#L1017-L1065)):

Use graphology library to represent model as directed acyclic graph (DAG):
- Store model as graph with artificial root node
- Parent relationships = edges in graph
- Child relationships = transpose of graph
- Paths computed on-demand via graph traversal (not stored)
  [sg] not a goal in itself, but graphology makes it easy
- Collections simplified to graph queries
- Relationships = edge lists
- [sg] not sure if this approach makes it easy to keep the graph
  features as part of Element or if it would exist beside
  the Element/ElementCollection classes
    - the collection classes could probably be hugely simplified
- [sg] Abstract Tree Rendering System
    - this will serve UI components, but they could also make
      use of graphology

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates manual tree construction code
- Powerful graph algorithms available
- Unified relationship model
- Easier to query and visualize

**Concerns**:
- Huge refactor touching most files
- New dependency and learning curve
- Unknown performance implications
- Possibly over-engineering

**Decision**: Implement incremental improvements first (pathFromRoot array, eliminate slotPath, centralize tree construction). Re-evaluate graph approach only if complexity remains high after these improvements.

---
### Performance Optimizations

When working with larger models or slower devices:
- **Virtualize long lists**: MeasurementObservation has 103 variables; consider react-window or react-virtual
- **Viewport culling for links**: Only render SVG links for visible elements
- **Animation library**: Consider react-spring for smoother transitions (current CSS transitions work fine)

---

### Review DOC_CONVENTIONS.md

**Goal**: Review DOC_CONVENTIONS.md and decide if there are parts worth keeping or integrating elsewhere
**Importance**: Low - documentation maintenance

---

### Semantic Relationship Features

**Context**: Semantic relationship patterns identified during analysis could be valuable for user-facing features

**Semantic patterns identified**:
1. **Containment/Part-of**: `parent_specimen`, `parent_container`, `part_of`
2. **Association**: `associated_participant`, `source_participant`, `performed_by`
3. **Activity/Process**: `creation_activity`, `processing_activity`, `storage_activity`
4. **Measurement**: `value_quantity`, `range_low`, `range_high`, `quantity_measure`
5. **Provenance**: `*_provenance`, `derived_from`
6. **Organization/Study**: `member_of_research_study`, `originating_site`

**Potential features**:
- User-facing documentation/tooltips
- Search result grouping by semantic category
- Suggested exploration paths ("Show specimen workflow", "Show participant data")
- AI-assisted query answering
- Smart search: "find containment relationships" could match `parent_*` and `part_of` patterns

**Implementation approach when ready**:
- Extract patterns from attribute names (regex/keyword matching)
- Make patterns configurable (JSON/YAML file of patterns)
- Use for suggestions/enhancements, not core functionality
- Keep structural navigation as primary interface

**Note**: This is a future enhancement - current structural approach (categorize by range: primitive/enum/class) is stable and schema-change-safe.
