Everything below this line is kept for the reasoning it records, not as a plan.
Where it conflicts with `OWNERSHIP_CLASSIFICATION.md`, the doc is right — it was
written from this file and then corrected against the code.

## 1. The color system — ✅ SHIPPED (verified 2026-09-04)

### 1.1 Three palettes

| | palette | entries | what carries it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1 — range** | ColorBrewer **Set1**, entity = blue | 4–5 | row dot, row range label, detail-panel badges |
| **P2 — direction** | ColorBrewer **Blues** | 3 | edge stroke, relation menu chip |
| **P3 — siblings** | ColorBrewer **Pastel1** | 5–6 | slot name, merged-box header |

**P1** is the range palette: entity, enum, data type, variable, and possibly a
fifth for "any range". Qualitative and unordered — Set1 gives maximum mutual
separation. It replaces both the Kitchen Sink element-type colors and the
Explorer detail-panel badge colors; **these are the same set of things and get
the same colors.** (`slot` was an element type in Kitchen Sink only; that idea
is abandoned; no other view needs a color for it.)

**P2** is not independent — it is a sequential ramp *of P1's entity hue*, so
every edge still reads as "entity relationship". Outgoing and incoming are the
same relation seen from two ends, so they sit **close on the ramp** (about
Blues 7 / 6): distinguishable, not dramatically different. **Edge strokes get a
little thicker** so a one-step gap stays legible. Association is **inside the
ramp** at a value that stays clearly visible — the dash pattern carries the
distinction, not faintness. The relation menu chip takes the main entity color.

**P3** distinguishes siblings from each other and supports eye-tracking between
a slot row and its target box. It does **not** need separation from P1, because
the two never share a position (P3 on slot names and headers, P1 on dots and
range labels). Pastel1's low saturation is what keeps it quiet. Five to six
entries covers today's largest group (`Observation`, 5 children); the palette
wraps if a group ever exceeds it.

**Index 0 of P3 is the default**, used for parent-declared slots and for every
box that is not an inheritance-merged box. It is **a significantly darkened form
of P1's entity color**, not a neutral gray: a box header is an entity, so its
header and its own slot names carry the entity identity, and sibling colors
read as departures from it. Header fill and slot-name text likely need two
different steps of that dark end — a fill dark enough for white text is too dark
for small text on a light background.

No other neutral is needed.

### 1.2 What each channel encodes

Per row in a box:

| channel | encodes | palette |
|---|---|---|
| row dot | the slot's range kind | P1 |
| row range label | the slot's range kind | P1 |
| slot name | which class declares it | P3 |
| box header | the class | P3 (default = the box's own) |
| edge stroke | direction | P2, overridden by P3 where colored |

Only **entity** ranges draw edges, so range kind contributes no variation to the
stroke — direction is the stroke's default encoding. The few edges whose
endpoint is a merged-box member override that with the P3 color; there are not
many, and the override is fine.

### 1.3 Sibling color assignment — ✅ SHIPPED

*(Historical framing — "the current scheme" below is the one this REPLACED, and
it is long gone. Line numbers throughout §1 are pre-implementation and stale.)*

Replaces the scheme that indexed by position among **selected** siblings, so
unselecting one shifted every later sibling's color.

Three steps:

1. **color every class stably.** For each parent with subclasses, index its
   children by position among **all** schema siblings sorted by id — not just
   the ones on canvas. The parent takes the default (P3 index 0). Build this
   once in `DataService`, which already does a whole-schema constructor pass
   (`ExploreApp.tsx:53-55`).
2. **color slot names by target:** `colorIndex[slot.range]`.
3. **If a slot name got a non-default color and its owner is a subclass, give
   the owner the same color.** The container borrows its contents' color.

> **All three steps shipped, and step 3 is the load-bearing one.** SG's
> statement of the algorithm (2026-09-04) is the one to keep:
>
> 1. all child headers coloured by palette ordering
>    (`buildSiblingColorIndex` → `siblingColor`);
> 2. slot rows pointing at child headers re-coloured by their target
>    (`DataService.getTargetColor`);
> 3. re-coloured slot rows re-colour the child headers they belong to
>    (the `borrowed` map in `mergeSiblings`, `OwnershipGraphView.tsx`).
>
> Step 3 applies only from a child's OWN rows: an inherited row is shared by
> every sibling, so letting it recolour one would hand that sibling a colour on
> the strength of something it does not uniquely have.
>
> Step 3 is what pairs a container with its contents. Sort order decides only
> WHICH colour a class wears, never WHETHER a pair matches — the two families
> sorting alike is a correspondence that exists today and is not used. Verified
> by hand (SG, 2026-09-04) by renaming `MeasurementObservationSet` and
> `SpecimenQualityObservation` so the families sort differently: colours moved,
> pairs held.

`mergeSiblings` then reads `siblingColor(colorIndex[mid])` instead of the loop
index. `dataService` is already in that `useMemo`'s dep list
(`OwnershipGraphView.tsx:1100`).

Step 3 is what keeps a container matched to what it contains. Verified against
the schema: the three `*ObservationSet.observations` rows match their targets,
`ObservationSet.observations → Observation` is default/default, and Specimen's
three measure slots take their targets' colors (Specimen is in no merged box,
so its own slot names would otherwise have none).

Slots inherited without a `slot_usage` override merge onto the parent's row and
have no child-specific row to color — `ImagingFile.derived_from` is the case to
check a rule against.

Classes whose parent is `Entity` are top-level and form no merged box.

**Where colors live:** ✅ done. `GRAPH_COLORS` is **gone** — it held the amber
`ownership` and slate `reference` this section planned to retire, and
`appConfig.ts` records its removal at the point where it used to sit. The three
palettes now live in `appConfig.ts` under the P1/P2/P3 headings, alongside
`APP_CONFIG.elementTypes`. The one surviving amber is the `slot` element type,
which approximates P1's Set1 brown for the Kitchen Sink — a loose end, since
this section declares that idea abandoned.

**Tests:** ✅ the middle-sibling case asked for below now exists
(`siblingMerge.test.ts`, "sibling colors are stable when a MIDDLE sibling is
unselected"), along with whole-schema independence, step-2 and step-3 coverage.
Original note kept for its reasoning: the old test checked stability for a
*fixed* member set, which is why the bug shipped. Note that colors are
per-group, so two classes at index 0 in different groups share a color by
design — that is **palette reuse**, not a collision (and not the pairing
mechanism; see the note under step 3).

The question worth testing is the one this paragraph originally asked — *do
paired container/contents still have matched colors?* — but **not** by way of
sort positions. Assert the mechanism directly: **a row's color equals its
target's color**, swept over the real schema. That is
`getTargetColor(range)` against the target's own
`siblingColor(siblingColorIndexOf(range))`, and no sort-order coincidence can
make it pass falsely.

⚠️ Do **not** write the test this paragraph used to describe — inserting a
'Foo' that sorts between paired names, added to one family and not the other,
then asserting the pairing survives. It was tried on 2026-09-04 and is wrong
twice over: it tests a sort-position correspondence the pairing never uses,
and (because `buildSiblingColorIndex` is private and schema-driven) it can
only be written by reimplementing the sort rule in the test, which then
asserts the reimplementation rather than the app. SG's hand experiment —
renaming two classes so the families sort differently, and seeing the pairing
hold — is the real check, and the row-equals-target test above is its
automated form.

## 2. Docs and help consolidation — ▶️ THE REMAINING WORK

### 2.1 `OWNERSHIP_CLASSIFICATION.md` — restructure

- **Strip historical material.** Keep what is current or planned; decision
  archaeology moves to `WORKLOG.md`.
- **Explain the relation vocabulary once, concisely** (see §3.1) — not as two
  parallel tables.
- **Minimize redundancy with help/tour.** Prefer a link plus a one-line summary.
  It is fine to draft prose here first and deploy it into help/tour after.
- **This is where non-user-facing technical material lives**, including the
  color system above once implemented and the edge-display survey (§4).

### [sg] overrides 2.2 and 2.3

next session should be interactive discussion stepping through
the existing tour and existing example cases. there's more good
stuff in the example cases than what got saved into TOUR_SOURCE_MATERIAL.md
and it could be used for the tour. sometimes the steps would be
the same but the text in the cases is often better. we might
possibly want more than one tour; not sure yet, but, if so the
'take the tour' pill and Help menu item could be combined.



### 2.2 "Example cases" → a cascading **Help** menu

`ExampleCasesPane.tsx` is today a floating pane with two tabs, `cases` and
`legend` (`:48`). These differ in kind and should not be tabs of one pane.
Replace with a top-level **Help** menu containing:

- **Ownership legend** — permanent. See §3.3.
- **Example cases** — keep, but **cull**. ~34 cases in `exampleCases.ts` is enough
  volume that there is no obvious place to start debugging from. Keep a case if it
  either **(a)** shows off a feature, or sets up a state that is interesting for a
  user to play with, or **(b)** covers a distinct semantic area of the model, so the
  set as a whole gives a feel for what the model spans. Debugging cases are not
  disqualified — many will pass (a). What goes is the first group of simple,
  user-directed cases: those predate the tour, which now does that job better.
  **"Biggest fans" stays here**, not in the legend.
- **Help-mode sections** worth surfacing. Do **not** reinstate help mode.

### 2.3 Tour steps for edge features

Add tour steps walking through the edge features. Format and traps: the
`project_tour_format` memory and `src/explore/help-content.md` (`Tour:` blocks,
`tourStateStack.ts`, `helpResolvers.ts`).

Which edge features the tour should cover is not yet decided — candidates are
the P1/P2/P3 color encodings, arrowhead direction, dashed association edges,
and a narrowed edge pointing at a child header. Settle the step list first.
**This is the highest-priority remaining item.**

### 2.4 `any_of` — a label, not a new edge type

One slot uses `any_of`: `MeasurementObservation.associated_artifact`
(`range: Entity`, `any_of: [Assay, File, QuestionnaireResponse]`). The verdict is
correct and the edge still points at `Entity`; the **label will explain what `any_of`
means** — that this slot may point at an `Assay`, a `File`, or a
`QuestionnaireResponse`.

`Assay` has zero inbound edges as a result, so it is unreachable by following an
edge (it is still selectable and displayable). **Preferred temporary fix: a note on `Assay`
explaining what attaches to it.**

Background: `OWNERSHIP_CLASSIFICATION.md` §`any_of`.

---

## 3. Open questions

### 3.1 The relation vocabulary — reframe (settled in shape, needs writing)

Not "3 verdicts vs 5 positions" but **three relation kinds, two of which can be
seen from three perspectives**:

```
2 (fwd, bkwd) × 3 (perspectives) + 1 (association) = 7
```
In the code today: `OwnershipVerdict` (3: `own-fwd`, `own-bkwd`, `association`,
in `containmentGraph.ts`) drives layering, stroke and arrowheads;
`RelationPosition` (5, `ownershipSubgraph.ts:66`) drives what the reader sees in
the relation bar's popovers, and is the 3 crossed with who declares the slot
(`ownershipSubgraph.ts:162,167`). Shipped user-facing labels
(`RELATION_POSITION_LABEL`):

 | position     | label                           |
 |--------------|---------------------------------|
 | `owns-mine`    | belong to me by my attribute    |
 | `owns-theirs`  | belong to me by their attribute |
 | `owned-mine`   | I belong to, by my attribute    |
 | `owned-theirs` | I belong to, by their attribute |
 | `association`  | associated with                 |

**color does not encode the perspective split** — with nothing hovered there is
no point of view, so P2 carries only the three kinds. The split belongs to
hover behaviour and label text.

### 3.2 Edge labels — settled: one label, on hover

There is **no `<text>` on the edge layer at all**, and after this decision there
still won't be. `TASKS.md` flags item 5 as a doc bug for asserting labels as
shipped. Today a flipped edge is marked only by a back-pointing arrowhead
(`arrow-own-back`).

**Decision (2026-09-02): no persistent edge labels. One label, shown on edge
hover, in a chip near the cursor, with its point of view chosen by which
endpoint the pointer is closer to.**

Why *always-on* is off the table — read off the rendered graph: edges are long
orthogonal runs with multiple bends, routed through the gaps between columns,
and they bundle where they arrive (the group entering `Entity`, the four
converging on `Observation`'s child headers). There is no dependable midpoint —
`Document.focus → Entity` has its midpoint in open space far from either end,
while `Condition.affected_body_site → BodySite` is a short hop with no room at
all. A label on the line collides with its neighbours in exactly the dense
regions where it would be most wanted.

Once always-on is gone, the close/middle/far geometry collapses. Hovering an
edge **is** a point of view — supplied by pointer proximity — so the neutral
middle label has no occasion to render, and one chip replaces three. The
existing 11px transparent hit path already provides the trigger.

Also settled: **entity hover does not label all of that entity's edges.**
`Observation` would sprout a dozen chips. Entity hover keeps its highlight;
the words stay in the relation bar, which already spells out the relationships.

Consequences for neighbouring items:

- **`any_of` (§2.4) does not need this mechanism.** One slot pointing at
  `Entity` and needing to say "may be an `Assay`, a `File`, or a
  `QuestionnaireResponse`" is a footnote on the **row**, not a label on the
  edge — a marker on `associated_artifact`, explained in the detail panel, plus
  the note on `Assay`. It is no longer the "first edge-label mechanism."
- **Rows are the other half of this.** A row already carries slot name, target
  and cardinality; the edge only has to say *where it goes*. Hovering the row
  and hovering the line leaving it are the same question asked from the same
  end, so they should share one component and one vocabulary — with the row
  version always taking the near/"mine" point of view. Deferred with §3.4.

Both tables below stay: they are the clearest statement of the relation
vocabulary anywhere in the repo, and they remain the source for cascading-menu
items, help text and the legend, whether or not a label ever renders. The
`close`/`far` columns are now reference material rather than a render spec.

To be precise about what proximity does: it selects the **row** — that is, the
point of view — and the `close` label is then what renders, at the near end.
It does not choose between the `close` and `far` columns; those are the same
relationship described from its two ends, not alternatives. Showing the `far`
label simultaneously at the other end, so the user reads the relationship from
both points of view at once, is possible but judged **excessive**: it doubles
the ink for something the reader gets by hovering the other end. The `middle`
column records the neutral phrasing for prose where no point of view exists.

### 3.3 What the ownership legend should be

An entity can be related to others in the following ways:

- Through inheritance, that is, IS-A relationships:
  - ObservationSet has subclasses: DimensionalObservationSet, MeasurementObservationSet, SdohObservationSet.
    These are set in the schema like, `MeasurementObservationSet.is_a = ObservationSet`.
  - Attributes on a subclass sometimes override attributes on the parent. So
    `ObservationSet.observations.range = Observation` but 
    `MeasurementObservationSet.observations.range = MeasurementObservation`.
- Through attributes with a class/entity range, i.e., HAS-A relationships:
  - Through attributes on the entity itself, in one of two ways:
    - "Containing" the other:
      - `MeasurementObservation.body_site` can optionally (0..1) connect
        to a BodySite -- the BodySite "belongs to" the MeasurementObservation
      - `ObservationSet.observations` contains one or more Observations
    - Being "contained by" the other:
      - ...
  - Through attributes on another entity:
    - ...

I was imagining this being easier to comprehend with pictures (NOT ascii,
looking like the app)

The legend should also explain the toolbar buttons, the colors, and dashed edges.

The by-reason breakdowns matter and must exist somewhere, but are too much for
the legend — put them in `OWNERSHIP_CLASSIFICATION.md` or a culled example case.

### 3.4 Popovers vs. title text

~~The relation-menu trigger's `title` tooltip covers the menu's own options when
the menu is open.~~ **FIXED 2026-09-04**, by the predicted route: the text moved
into the panel as a header line. Worth keeping because it recurred — the same
mistake was made again in the relation bar that replaced the menu, minutes after
it shipped. **Standing rule: no native `title` on anything that opens a hover
panel**; use `aria-label` and put the words in the panel.

**No new popovers for now** (settled 2026-09-02). Entity-title and row popovers
were considered and deferred: what they would carry is part of a larger pass on
getting all the detail into one place — several things still require going back
to an earlier view — and that pass comes *after* the tour is authored. The
detail panel stays as-is until then; whether a row popover would duplicate or
replace its slot content is deferred with it.

Whenever popovers do land, they want to be **one primitive** (positioning,
delay, dismissal, z-order above both the SVG and the node divs) with different
content per trigger, or the entity-title and row versions will drift apart.

### 3.5 Terminology: "merged"

**Settled: "merged-inheritance".** A class and its descendants drawn as one box
is a **merged-inheritance box**. Edge convergence (several edges sharing one
arrowhead) keeps the word "merge" in `mergeTargets` and is a different thing.
Apply to identifiers (`mergeSiblings`, `isMergedId`, `merged::`) as well as prose.

### 3.6 "N related" counts distinct OUTSIDE classes

`countsOf` counts distinct related class names, and a merged-inheritance box
excludes anything folded into itself (`notSelfOrMember`,
`OwnershipGraphView.tsx:573`). So **selecting more can make the number go down**:
with `Observation` unchecked it is not a member of the box named after it, so
`ObservationSet`'s relation to it counts as outside (6); check it and the count
falls to 5.

Correct but counter-intuitive, and **more confusing still across combinations of
several checkboxes.** Not being fixed now. Leave a clear explanation in
`OWNERSHIP_CLASSIFICATION.md`.

## 4. Edge display — current state

Park this survey in `OWNERSHIP_CLASSIFICATION.md`.

1. **Labels** — specified, never built (§3.2).
2. **Source rows** — fixed (`4bd5755`). One edge per declaring class, leaving
   that class's own row. The port id is keyed on `(anchorClass, slot)`, the same
   pair `rowY` resolves by; keyed on slot name alone, every edge in a merged box
   shared one port. `TASKS.md`'s "Edge rendering — the fan from
   `ObservationSet.observations`" section **needs updating to record this as
   delivered.**
3. **Target rows** — **DONE 2026-09-02.** A `slot_usage`-narrowed edge points at
   the child header matching its range, not the box header. Row-targeted edges
   opt out of `mergeTargets` and draw their own arrowhead; both fan passes skip
   them. The no-merge shortcut rests on a schema property (no family member has
   more than one inbound edge) that `mergedEdges.test.ts` now guards — a
   failure there means the schema changed, not the code. Full record in
   `TASKS.md`, "✅ DONE — a narrowed edge points at the CHILD's header".
4. **colors** — ✅ replaced wholesale; see §1.
5. **Adjacent** — curved edges removed 2026-08-19; one-arrowhead-per-convergence
   and thinner strokes shipped. Markers use `markerUnits="userSpaceOnUse"` so
   they do not scale with `strokeWidth`; one marker serves both ends via
   `orient="auto-start-reverse"`. Dragging still lacks obstacle-aware routing and
   URL persistence.

## 5. Pointers

- `docs/OWNERSHIP_CLASSIFICATION.md` — rules, measured counts (149 edges as of
  `28007df`, measured 2026-08-31), the `any_of` section.
- `docs/EXPLORE_VIZ.md` — visual-design conclusions. **~20–25% stale** as audited
  2026-08-24; item 1 is current, items 2, 3, 5, 6 are not. Check `TASKS.md`'s
  audit before citing.
- `docs/TASKS.md` — the edge-display cluster; two sections need updating (§4).
- `src/config/appConfig.ts` — `GRAPH_COLORS`, `APP_CONFIG.elementTypes`.
- `src/models/containmentGraph.ts` — `classifySlotEdgeExplained`, rule sets,
  `OWNERSHIP_RULE_TEXT`.
- `src/models/ownershipSubgraph.ts` — `RelationPosition`,
  `RELATION_POSITION_LABEL`, `buildOwnershipDag`, `computeSunkLayers`.
- `src/explore/OwnershipGraphView.tsx` — `mergeSiblings`, `countsOf`,
  `notSelfOrMember`, the free-end fan, `rowY`, `mergeTargets`.
- `src/explore/siblingMerge.ts` — `groupSiblings`, `siblingColor`,
  `MergedMember`.
- `src/test/siblingMerge.test.ts`, `src/test/mergedEdges.test.ts`.
- `src/explore/OwnershipLegend.tsx`, `ExampleCasesPane.tsx`, `exampleCases.ts`,
  `RelationBar.tsx`, `help-content.md`, `tourStateStack.ts`.

**Verification:** `npm run build` (~2s; `npx tsc --noEmit` is too weak and has let
breakage through) and `npx vitest run`. Never run `npm run dev` — Siggie keeps one
running.
