"""Audit an upstream schema sync for the failures that don't announce themselves.

The vitest suite already catches uncategorized classes and stale category
entries. This script covers what nothing else does:

  1. Class/slot adds, drops and renames between two processed.json snapshots.
  2. Hand-curated override sets in src/models/containmentGraph.ts whose members
     no longer exist in the schema (they are keyed by slot NAME, and a rename
     removes them silently -- no error, no test failure).
  3. Slots whose range or multivalued flag changed. RANGE is a classifier
     input -- the same slot can flip own-fwd <-> own-bkwd without appearing in
     any diff you'd think to read. `multivalued` no longer decides ownership
     (2026-09-13, TASKS `one-rule-ownership`) but is still reported: it changes
     the cardinality label, and a slot going 0..1 -> 0..* is worth a look.

     A NEW RANGE now defaults to owned, since the rule is "an attribute owns
     what it points at" and only listed exceptions flip. So a sync that
     introduces a referred-to entity needs it added to REFERRED_TO_ENTITIES by
     hand -- see "Classes added" above; nothing here can infer it.
  4. Classes with zero inbound ownership edges ("false roots"). This is the
     2026-08-31 failure mode: widening associated_artifact's range to Entity
     stranded Assay as a root. No config was stale and no test went red; the
     diagram just quietly got worse.

Ownership verdicts come from the REAL classifier in
src/models/containmentGraph.ts, via scripts/dump_classifier.test.ts -- not from
a Python copy of its rules. That means this script needs node_modules present
(`npm ci`), which is the price of not having two copies of the rules drift.

Usage:
    audit_schema_sync.py                  # working tree vs. merge-base with main
    audit_schema_sync.py --base main --head schema-sync/upstream-update
    audit_schema_sync.py --base-file old.json --head-file new.json

Exit codes: 0 = nothing needing judgment, 1 = review items found, 2 = error.
