 * DESCRIPTION, which is not a beat -- one click in and you are on beat 1. The
 * popover carries its own address in `data-step-address`: `rows-and-dots` for
 * the description, then `rows-and-dots~1`, `~2`, ... for beats.
 * `.help-tour-count` ("3 / 8") is the STEP counter and reads the same on every
 * beat of a step, so it cannot tell them apart.
 *
 * ⚠️ `data-step-address`, NOT the visible `.help-popover-address` tag. The
 * tag is authoring furniture, which `probe.fixture.ts` turns off for every
 * run so the popover measures the same here as in production.
 *
 * Counting clicks is not wrong in itself, but it is not self-checking: a wrong
 * assumption about where a step starts survives every later step. Reading the
 * address fails loudly instead.
